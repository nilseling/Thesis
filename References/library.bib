abstract = {Single-cell transcriptomics allows researchers to investigate complex communities of heterogeneous cells. These methods can be applied to stem cells and their descendants in order to chart the progression from multipotent progenitors to fully differentiated cells. While a number of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for analyzing cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve. Here, we introduce a novel method, Slingshot, for inferring multiple developmental lineages from single-cell gene expression data. Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool for inferring developmental lineages and ordering cells to reflect continuous, branching processes.},

These cells show distinct architecture and transduce the light signal by different phototransductory cascades. In the marine rag-worm Platynereis, we find both cell types: rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in the eyes and ciliary photoreceptor cells in the brain. The latter use a photopigment closely related to vertebrate rod and cone opsins. Comparative analysis indicates that both types of photoreceptors, with distinct opsins, coexisted in Urbilateria, the last common ancestor of insects and vertebrates, and sheds new light on vertebrate eye evolution.},

abstract = {The choice of using one of many possible neurotransmitter systems is a critical step in defining the identity of an individual neuron type. We show here that the key defining feature of glutamatergic neurons, the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4/VGLUT, is expressed in 38 of the 118 anatomically defined neuron classes of the C. elegans nervous system. We show that distinct cis-regulatory modules drive expression of eat-4/VGLUT in distinct glutamatergic neuron classes. We identify 13 different transcription factors, 11 of them homeodomain proteins, that act in distinct combinations in 25 different glutamatergic neuron classes to initiate and maintain eat-4/VGLUT expression. We show that the adoption of a glutamatergic phenotype is linked to the adoption of other terminal identity features of a neuron, including cotransmitter phenotypes. Examination of mouse orthologs of these homeodomain proteins resulted in the identification of mouse LHX1 as a regulator of glutamatergic neurons in the brainstem. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii is emerging as a powerful lophotrochozoan experimental model for evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) and neurobiology. Recent studies revealed the presence of conserved neuropeptidergic signaling in Platynereis, including vasotocin/neurophysin, myoinhibitory peptide and opioid peptidergic systems. Despite these advances, comprehensive peptidome resources have yet to be reported.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The present work describes the neuropeptidome of Platynereis. We established a large transcriptome resource, consisting of stage-specific next-generation sequencing datasets and 77,419 expressed sequence tags. Using this information and a combination of bioinformatic searches and mass spectrometry analyses, we increased the known proneuropeptide (pNP) complement of Platynereis to 98. Based on sequence homology to metazoan pNPs, Platynereis pNPs were grouped into ancient eumetazoan, bilaterian, protostome, lophotrochozoan, and annelid families, and pNPs only found in Platynereis. Compared to the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, the only other lophotrochozoan with a large-scale pNP resource, Platynereis has a remarkably full complement of conserved pNPs, with 53 pNPs belonging to ancient eumetazoan or bilaterian families. Our comprehensive search strategy, combined with analyses of sequence conservation, also allowed us to define several novel lophotrochozoan and annelid pNP families. The stage-specific transcriptome datasets also allowed us to map changes in pNP expression throughout the Platynereis life cycle.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The large repertoire of conserved pNPs in Platynereis highlights the usefulness of annelids in comparative neuroendocrinology. This work establishes a reference dataset for comparative peptidomics in lophotrochozoans and provides the basis for future studies of Platynereis peptidergic signaling.},

abstract = {Exquisitely precise synapse formation is crucial for the mammalian CNS to function correctly. Retinal photoreceptors transfer information to bipolar and horizontal cells at a specialized synapse, the ribbon synapse. We identified pikachurin, an extracellular matrix-like retinal protein, and observed that it localized to the synaptic cleft in the photoreceptor ribbon synapse. Pikachurin null-mutant mice showed improper apposition of the bipolar cell dendritic tips to the photoreceptor ribbon synapses, resulting in alterations in synaptic signal transmission and visual function. Pikachurin colocalized with both dystrophin and dystroglycan at the ribbon synapses. Furthermore, we observed direct biochemical interactions between pikachurin and dystroglycan. Together, our results identify pikachurin as a dystroglycan-interacting protein and demonstrate that it has an essential role in the precise interactions between the photoreceptor ribbon synapse and the bipolar dendrites. This may also advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the retinal electrophysiological abnormalities observed in muscular dystrophy patients.},

To identify conserved, and thus phylogenetically ancient, components of neurosecretory brain centers, we characterize and compare neurons that express the prohormone vasotocin (vasopressin/oxytocin)-neurophysin in the developing forebrain of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii and of the zebrafish. These neurons express the same tissue-restricted microRNA, miR-7, and conserved, cell-type-specific combinations of transcription factors (nk2.1, rx, and otp) that specify their identity, as evidenced by the specific requirement of zebrafish rx3 for vasotocin-neurophysin expression. MiR-7 also labels another shared population of neurons containing RFamides. Since the vasotocinergic and RFamidergic neurons appear to be directly sensory in annelid and fish, we propose that cell types with dual sensory-neurosecretory properties were the starting point for the evolution of neurosecretory brain centers in Bilateria.},

Annelids belong to Bilateria, an evolutionary lineage of bilateral animals that also includes vertebrates and insects. Comparing nervous system development in annelids to that of other bilaterians could provide valuable information about the common ancestor of all Bilateria. We find that the Platynereis neuroectoderm is subdivided into longitudinal progenitor domains by partially overlapping expression regions of nk and pax genes. These domains match corresponding domains in the vertebrate neural tube and give rise to conserved neural cell types. As in vertebrates, neural patterning genes are sensitive to Bmp signaling. Our data indicate that this mediolateral architecture was present in the last common bilaterian ancestor and thus support a common origin of nervous system centralization in Bilateria.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Planktonic ciliated larvae are characteristic for the life cycle of marine invertebrates. Their most prominent feature is the apical organ harboring sensory cells and neurons of largely undetermined function. An elucidation of the relationships between various forms of primary larvae and apical organs is key to understanding the evolution of animal life cycles. These relationships have remained enigmatic due to the scarcity of comparative molecular data. RESULTS: To compare apical organs and larval body patterning, we have studied regionalization of the episphere, the upper hemisphere of the trochophore larva of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We examined the spatial distribution of transcription factors and of Wnt signaling components previously implicated in anterior neural development. Pharmacological activation of Wnt signaling with Gsk3beta antagonists abolishes expression of apical markers, consistent with a repressive role of Wnt signaling in the specification of apical tissue. We refer to this Wnt-sensitive, six3- and foxq2-expressing part of the episphere as the 'apical plate'. We also unraveled a molecular signature of the apical organ--devoid of six3 but expressing foxj, irx, nkx3 and hox--that is shared with other marine phyla including cnidarians. Finally, we characterized the cell types that form part of the apical organ by profiling by image registration, which allows parallel expression profiling of multiple cells. Besides the hox-expressing apical tuft cells, this revealed the presence of putative light- and mechanosensory as well as multiple peptidergic cell types that we compared to apical organ cell types of other animal phyla. CONCLUSIONS: The similar formation of a six3+, foxq2+ apical plate, sensitive to Wnt activity and with an apical tuft in its six3-free center, is most parsimoniously explained by evolutionary conservation. We propose that a simple apical organ--comprising an apical tuft and a basal plexus innervated by sensory-neurosecretory apical plate cells--was present in the last common ancestors of cnidarians and bilaterians. One of its ancient functions would have been the control of metamorphosis. Various types of apical plate cells would then have subsequently been added to the apical organ in the divergent bilaterian lineages. Our findings support an ancient and common origin of primary ciliated larvae.},

abstract = {Cilia-based locomotion is the major form of locomotion for microscopic planktonic organisms in the ocean. Given their negative buoyancy, these organisms must control ciliary activity to maintain an appropriate depth. The neuronal bases of depth regulation in ciliary swimmers are unknown. To gain insights into depth regulation we studied ciliary locomotor control in the planktonic larva of the marine annelid, Platynereis. We found several neuropeptides expressed in distinct sensory neurons that innervate locomotor cilia. Neuropeptides altered ciliary beat frequency and the rate of calcium-evoked ciliary arrests. These changes influenced larval orientation, vertical swimming, and sinking, resulting in upward or downward shifts in the steady-state vertical distribution of larvae. Our findings indicate that Platynereis larvae have depth-regulating peptidergic neurons that directly translate sensory inputs into locomotor output on effector cilia. We propose that the simple circuitry found in these ciliated larvae represents an ancestral state in nervous system evolution.},

Despite its ubiquitous presence in Metazoa, the function of melatonin signaling outside vertebrates is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of melatonin signaling on circadian swimming behavior in a zooplankton model, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We find that melatonin is produced in brain photoreceptors with a vertebrate-type opsin-based phototransduction cascade and a light-entrained clock. Melatonin released at night induces rhythmic burst firing of cholinergic neurons that innervate locomotor-ciliated cells. This establishes a nocturnal behavioral state by modulating the length and the frequency of ciliary arrests. Based on our findings, we propose that melatonin signaling plays a role in the circadian control of ciliary swimming to adjust the vertical position of zooplankton in response to ambient light.},

RESULTS: We identified in silico the putative full complement of bHLH genes in the sequenced genomes of 12 different species representative of the main metazoan lineages, including three non-bilaterian metazoans, the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata and the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. We have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of the 695 identified bHLHs, which has allowed us to allocate most of these bHLHs to defined evolutionary conserved groups of orthology. CONCLUSION: Three main features in the history of the bHLH gene superfamily can be inferred from these analyses: (i) an initial diversification of the bHLHs has occurred in the pre-Cambrian, prior to metazoan cladogenesis; (ii) a second expansion of the bHLH superfamily occurred early in metazoan evolution before bilaterians and cnidarians diverged; and (iii) the bHLH complement during the evolution of the bilaterians has been remarkably stable. We suggest that these features may be extended to other developmental gene families and reflect a general trend in the evolution of the developmental gene repertoires of metazoans.},

abstract = {Assembly of a functioning neuronal synapse requires the precisely coordinated synthesis of many proteins. To understand the evolution of this complex cellular machine, we tracked the developmental expression patterns of a core set of conserved synaptic genes across a representative sampling of the animal kingdom. Coregulation, as measured by correlation of gene expression over development, showed a marked increase as functional nervous systems emerged. In the earliest branching animal phyla (Porifera), in which a nearly complete set of synaptic genes exists in the absence of morphological synapses, these "protosynaptic" genes displayed a lack of global coregulation although small modules of coexpressed genes are readily detectable by using network analysis techniques. These findings suggest that functional synapses evolved by exapting preexisting cellular machines, likely through some modification of regulatory circuitry. Evolutionarily ancient modules continue to operate seamlessly within the synapses of modern animals. This work shows that the application of network techniques to emerging genomic and expression data can provide insights into the evolution of complex cellular machines such as the synapse.},

abstract = {The question of whether the ancestral bilaterian had a central nervous system (CNS) or a diffuse ectodermal nervous system has been hotly debated. Considerable evidence supports the theory that a CNS evolved just once. However, an alternative view proposes that the chordate CNS evolved from the ectodermal nerve net of a hemichordate-like ancestral deuterostome, implying independent evolution of the CNS in chordates and protostomes. To specify morphological divisions along the anterior/posterior axis, this ancestor used gene networks homologous to those patterning three organizing centers in the vertebrate brain: the anterior neural ridge, the zona limitans intrathalamica and the isthmic organizer, and subsequent evolution of the vertebrate brain involved elaboration of these ancestral signaling centers; however, all or part of these signaling centers were lost from the CNS of invertebrate chordates. The present review analyzes the evidence for and against these theories. The bulk of the evidence indicates that a CNS evolved just once - in the ancestral bilaterian. Importantly, in both protostomes and deuterostomes, the CNS represents a portion of a generally neurogenic ectoderm that is internalized and receives and integrates inputs from sensory cells in the remainder of the ectoderm. The expression patterns of genes involved in medio/lateral (dorso/ventral) patterning of the CNS are similar in protostomes and chordates; however, these genes are not similarly expressed in the ectoderm outside the CNS. Thus, their expression is a better criterion for CNS homologs than the expression of anterior/posterior patterning genes, many of which (for example, Hox genes) are similarly expressed both in the CNS and in the remainder of the ectoderm in many bilaterians. The evidence leaves hemichordates in an ambiguous position - either CNS centralization was lost to some extent at the base of the hemichordates, or even earlier, at the base of the hemichordates + echinoderms, or one of the two hemichordate nerve cords is homologous to the CNS of protostomes and chordates. In any event, the presence of part of the genetic machinery for the anterior neural ridge, the zona limitans intrathalamica and the isthmic organizer in invertebrate chordates together with similar morphology indicates that these organizers were present, at least in part, at the base of the chordates and were probably elaborated upon in the vertebrate lineage.},

abstract = {Life-cycle transitions connecting larval and juvenile stages in metazoans are orchestrated by neuroendocrine signals including neuropeptides and hormones. In marine invertebrate life cycles, which often consist of planktonic larval and benthic adult stages, settlement of the free-swimming larva to the sea floor in response to environmental cues is a key life cycle transition. Settlement is regulated by a specialized sensory-neurosecretory system, the larval apical organ. The neuroendocrine mechanisms through which the apical organ transduces environmental cues into behavioral responses during settlement are not yet understood. Here we show that myoinhibitory peptide (MIP)/allatostatin-B, a pleiotropic neuropeptide widespread among protostomes, regulates larval settlement in the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. MIP is expressed in chemosensory-neurosecretory cells in the annelid larval apical organ and signals to its receptor, an orthologue of the Drosophila sex peptide receptor, expressed in neighboring apical organ cells. We demonstrate by morpholino-mediated knockdown that MIP signals via this receptor to trigger settlement. These results reveal a role for a conserved MIP receptor-ligand pair in regulating marine annelid settlement.},

abstract = {The larval stages of polychaete annelids are often responsive to light and can possess one to six eyes. The early trochophore larvae of the errant annelid Platynereis dumerilii have a single pair of ventral eyespots, whereas older nectochaete larvae have an additional two pairs of dorsal eyes that will develop into the adult eyes. Early Platynereis trochophores show robust positive phototaxis starting on the first day of development. Even though the mechanism of phototaxis in Platynereis early trochophore larvae is well understood, no photopigment (opsin) expression has yet been described in this stage. In late trochophore larvae, a rhabdomeric-type opsin, r-opsin1, expressed in both the eyespots and the adult eyes has already been reported. Here, we identify another Platynereis rhabdomeric opsin, r-opsin3, that is expressed in a single photoreceptor in the eyespots in early trochophores, suggesting that it mediates early larval phototaxis. We also show that r-opsin1 and r-opsin3 are expressed in adjacent photoreceptor cells in the eyespots in later stages, indicating that a second eyespot-photoreceptor differentiates in late trochophore larvae. Using serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we identified and reconstructed both photoreceptors and a pigment cell in the late larval eyespot. We also characterized opsin expression in the adult eyes and found that the two opsins co-express there in several photoreceptor cells. Using antibodies recognizing r-opsin1 and r-opsin3 proteins, we demonstrate that both opsins localize to the rhabdomere in all six eyes. In addition, we found that r-opsin1 mRNA is localized to, and translated in, the projections of the adult eyes. The specific changes we describe in opsin transcription and translation and in the cellular complement suggest that the six larval eyes undergo spectral and functional maturation during the early planktonic phase of the Platynereis life cycle.},

Using a newly developed protocol for cellular profiling by image registration (PrImR), we obtain a high-resolution gene expression map for the developing annelid brain. Comparison to the vertebrate pallium reveals that the annelid mushroom bodies develop from similar molecular coordinates within a conserved overall molecular brain topology and that their development involves conserved patterning mechanisms and produces conserved neuron types that existed already in the protostome-deuterostome ancestors. These data indicate deep homology of pallium and mushroom bodies and date back the origin of higher brain centers to prebilaterian times. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Neuropeptides are signaling molecules that commonly act via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are generated in neurons by proneuropeptide (pNP) cleavage. Present in both cnidarians and bilaterians, neuropeptides represent an ancient and widespread mode of neuronal communication. Due to the inherent difficulties of analyzing highly diverse and repetitive pNPs, the relationships among different families are often elusive. Using similarity-based clustering and sensitive similarity searches, I obtained a global view of metazoan pNP diversity and evolution. Clustering revealed a large and diffuse network of sequences connected by significant sequence similarity encompassing one-quarter of all families. pNPs belonging to this cluster were also identified in the early-branching neuronless animal Trichoplax adhaerens. Clustering of neuropeptide GPCRs identified several orthology groups and allowed the reconstruction of the phyletic distribution of receptor families. GPCR phyletic distribution closely paralleled that of pNPs, indicating extensive conservation and long-term coevolution of receptor-ligand pairs. Receptor orthology and intermediate sequences also revealed the homology of pNPs so far considered unrelated, including allatotropin and orexin. These findings, together with the identification of deuterostome achatin and luqin and protostome opioid pNPs, extended the neuropeptide complement of the urbilaterian. Several pNPs were also identified from the hemichordate Saccoglossus kowalevskii and the cephalochordate Branchiostoma floridae, elucidating pNP evolution in deuterostomes. Receptor-ligand conservation also allowed ligand predictions for many uncharacterized GPCRs from nonmodel species. The reconstruction of the neuropeptide-signaling repertoire at deep nodes of the animal phylogeny allowed the formulation of a testable scenario of the evolution of animal neuroendocrine systems.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The recent advent of methods for high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling has catalyzed a growing sense in the scientific community that the time is ripe to complete the 150-year-old effort to identify all cell types in the human body. The Human Cell Atlas Project is an international collaborative effort that aims to define all human cell types in terms of distinctive molecular profiles (such as gene expression profiles) and to connect this information with classical cellular descriptions (such as location and morphology). An open comprehensive reference map of the molecular state of cells in healthy human tissues would propel the systematic study of physiological states, developmental trajectories, regulatory circuitry and interactions of cells, and also provide a framework for understanding cellular dysregulation in human disease. Here we describe the idea, its potential utility, early proofs-of-concept, and some design considerations for the Human Cell Atlas, including a commitment to open data, code, and community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The transcriptional co-activator BOB.1/OBF.1 was originally identified in B cells and is constitutively expressed throughout B cell development. BOB.1/OBF.1 associates with the transcription factors Oct1 and Oct2, thereby enhancing octamer-dependent transcription. In contrast, in T cells, BOB.1/OBF.1 expression is inducible by treatment of cells with PMA/Ionomycin or by antigen receptor engagement, indicating a marked difference in the regulation of BOB.1/OBF.1 expression in B versus T cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 in T and B cells remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study focuses on mechanisms controlling the transcriptional regulation of BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2 in T cells. We show that both calcineurin- and NF-$\kappa$B-inhibitors efficiently attenuate the expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2 in T cells. In silico analyses of the BOB.1/OBF.1 promoter revealed the presence of previously unappreciated combined NFAT/NF-$\kappa$B sites. An array of genetic and biochemical analyses illustrates the involvement of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin as well as NFAT and NF-$\kappa$B transcription factors in the transcriptional regulation of octamer-dependent transcription in T cells. Conclusively, impaired expression of BOB.1/OBF.1 and Oct2 and therefore a hampered octamer-dependent transcription may participate in T cell-mediated immunodeficiency caused by the deletion of NFAT or NF-$\kappa$B transcription factors.},

abstract = {Transcription in eukaryotic cells has been described as quantal, with pulses of messenger RNA produced in a probabilistic manner. This description reflects the inherently stochastic nature of gene expression, known to be a major factor in the heterogeneous response of individual cells within a clonal population to an inducing stimulus. Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise) arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in contrast to observations in prokaryotes, and that such noise can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show that pulsatile mRNA production, through reinitiation, is crucial for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency, highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell-cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation.},

abstract = {Morphogens provide positional information for spatial patterns of gene expression during development. However, stochastic effects such as local fluctuations in morphogen concentration and noise in signal transduction make it difficult for cells to respond to their positions accurately enough to generate sharp boundaries between gene expression domains. During development of rhombomeres in the zebrafish hindbrain, the morphogen retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of hoxb1a in rhombomere 4 (r4) and krox20 in r3 and r5. Fluorescent in situ hybridization reveals rough edges around these gene expression domains, in which cells co-express hoxb1a and krox20 on either side of the boundary, and these sharpen within a few hours. Computational analysis of spatial stochastic models shows, surprisingly, that noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression actually promotes sharpening of boundaries between adjacent segments. In particular, fluctuations in RA initially induce a rough boundary that requires noise in hoxb1a/krox20 expression to sharpen. This finding suggests a novel noise attenuation mechanism that relies on intracellular noise to induce switching and coordinate cellular decisions during developmental patterning.},

abstract = {The accumulation of somatic DNA damage has been implicated as a cause of ageing in metazoa. One possible mechanism by which increased DNA damage could lead to cellular degeneration and death is by stochastic deregulation of gene expression. Here we directly test for increased transcriptional noise in aged tissue by dissociating single cardiomyocytes from fresh heart samples of both young and old mice, followed by global mRNA amplification and quantification of mRNA levels in a panel of housekeeping and heart-specific genes. Although gene expression levels already varied among cardiomyocytes from young heart, this heterogeneity was significantly elevated at old age. We had demonstrated previously an increased load of genome rearrangements and other mutations in the heart of aged mice. To confirm that increased stochasticity of gene expression could be a result of increased genome damage, we treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in culture with hydrogen peroxide. Such treatment resulted in a significant increase in cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, which was found to parallel the induction and persistence of genome rearrangement mutations at a lacZ reporter locus. These results underscore the stochastic nature of the ageing process, and could provide a mechanism for age-related cellular degeneration and death in tissues of multicellular organisms.},

abstract = {Chromatin remodeling during spermiogenesis is characterized by a series of nuclear protein replacements. Histones are replaced by transition nuclear proteins, which are in turn replaced by protamines. The transition nuclear proteins, TP1 and TP2, and the protamines, PRM1 and PRM2, are the major nuclear proteins involved in this process. Biochemical studies of mice with null mutations in one of the Tnp genes showed that the absence of one TP led to an apparent elevation in the amount of the remaining TP in the testis. To investigate the mechanism of changes of protein levels and effects of one Tnp mutation on other nuclear proteins, we used immunohistochemistry techniques to determine the distribution of these nuclear proteins. In contrast to previous biochemical analyses, which indicated that nuclear protein replacement was sequential with little overlap between the protein types, we found considerable overlap in the nucleoprotein types during spermiogenesis. The TPs, which appear in the nucleus before histone displacement is complete, were shared among genetically inequivalent spermatids. The absence of one TP did not affect the time of appearance of the other TP or of the protamines, but it did affect the displacement of the other TP, leading to its abnormal retention in the nucleus. The elevated levels of the remaining TP in Tnp-mutant mice appeared to be a consequence of the prolonged retention, rather than increased synthesis. Thus the absence of one of the TPs did not significantly affect transcription or translation of the other basic proteins, but it did affect posttranslational events.},

The data from each single cell are sparse, comprising on the order of 1,000 unique reads. However, by assaying thousands of ES cells, we identify a spectrum of subpopulations defined by differences in chromatin signatures of pluripotency and differentiation priming. We corroborate these findings by comparison to orthogonal single-cell gene expression data.

abstract = {We present an efficient procedure for estimating the marginal likelihood of probabilistic models with latent variables or incomplete data. This method constructs and optimises a lower bound on the marginal likelihood using variational calculus, resulting in an iterative algorithm which generalises the EM algorithm by maintaining posterior distributions over both latent variables and parameters. We define the family of conjugate-exponential models—which includes finite mixtures of exponential family models, factor analysis, hidden Markov models, linear state-space models, and other models of interest—for which this bound on the marginal likelihood can be computed very simply through a modification of the standard EM algorithm. In particular, we focus on applying these bounds to the problem of scoring discrete directed graphical model structures (Bayesian networks). Extensive simulations comparing the variational bounds to the usual approach based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and to a sampling-based gold standard method known as Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) show that variational bounds substantially outperform BIC in finding the correct model structure at relatively little computational cost, while approaching the performance of the much more costly AIS procedure. Using AIS allows us to provide the first serious case study of the tightness of variational bounds. We also analyse the perfomance of AIS through a variety of criteria, and outline directions in which this work can be extended.},

To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase CARM1 and is lowered following CARM1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation.},

abstract = {In individual cells, transcription is a random process obeying single-molecule kinetics. Often, it occurs in a bursty, intermittent manner. The frequency and size of these bursts affect the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in messenger RNA and protein content within a cell, creating variation or “noise” in gene expression. It is still unclear to what degree transcriptional kinetics are specific to each gene and determined by its promoter sequence. Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenarios—namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kinetics—may be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular and genetic analyses conducted in model organisms such as Drosophila and vertebrates, have provided a wealth of information about how networks of transcription factors control the proper development of these species. Much less is known, however, about the evolutionary origin of these elaborated networks and their large-scale evolution. Here we report the first evolutionary analysis of a whole superfamily of transcription factors, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, at the scale of the whole metazoan kingdom. RESULTS: We identified in silico the putative full complement of bHLH genes in the sequenced genomes of 12 different species representative of the main metazoan lineages, including three non-bilaterian metazoans, the cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata and the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica. We have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of the 695 identified bHLHs, which has allowed us to allocate most of these bHLHs to defined evolutionary conserved groups of orthology. CONCLUSION: Three main features in the history of the bHLH gene superfamily can be inferred from these analyses: (i) an initial diversification of the bHLHs has occurred in the pre-Cambrian, prior to metazoan cladogenesis; (ii) a second expansion of the bHLH superfamily occurred early in metazoan evolution before bilaterians and cnidarians diverged; and (iii) the bHLH complement during the evolution of the bilaterians has been remarkably stable. We suggest that these features may be extended to other developmental gene families and reflect a general trend in the evolution of the developmental gene repertoires of metazoans.},

abstract = {Signalling pathways are essential for the correct development of the central nervous system (CNS) in bilaterian animals. Here we show that in the CNS of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) are located close to the ventral midline and express axin, a negative regulator of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway. Using pharmacological inhibitors, we observe that Wnt/$\beta$-catenin is required for the transition between proliferating NPCs and differentiating neurons. We also show that the Rho-associated kinase (Rok) is necessary for neurectoderm morphogenesis and ventral midline formation, and indirectly affects the distribution of the NPCs and the development of axonal scaffolds. Moreover, seven genes belonging to the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway are expressed in the developing Platynereis neurectoderm, suggesting an involvement in its morphogenesis. When compared with previous studies in vertebrates, our data suggest that the involvement of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway in the control of neural cell proliferation/differentiation is ancestral to bilaterians.},

abstract = {Stochasticity is a hallmark of cellular processes, and different classes of genes show large differences in their cell-to-cell variability (noise). To decipher the sources and consequences of this noise, we systematically measured pairwise correlations between large numbers of genes, including those with high variability. We find that there is substantial pathway variability shared across similarly regulated genes. This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated " noise regulons" operate across a yeast cell and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes. Finally, we show that pathway noise is a quantitative tool for exploring pathway features and regulatory relationships in un-stimulated systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

@article{Cai2006,
abstract = {In a living cell, gene expression--the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA followed by translation to protein--occurs stochastically, as a consequence of the low copy number of DNA and mRNA molecules involved. These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic-based assay that allows real-time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression--the burst size and frequency--can be either determined directly from real-time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady-state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels, and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system-wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins.},

abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What is the differentiation stage of human testicular interstitial cells, in particular Leydig cells (LC), within micronodules found in patients with infertility, testicular cancer and Klinefelter syndrome?$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY ANSWER: The Leydig- and peritubular-cell populations in testes with dysgenesis contain an increased proportion of undifferentiated cells when compared with control samples, as demonstrated by increased delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1) and decreased insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) expression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Normal LC function is essential for male development and reproduction. Signs of LC failure, including LC micronodules, are often observed in patients with reproductive disorders.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective study, a panel of markers and factors linked to the differentiation of LCs was investigated in 33 fetal and prepubertal human specimens and in 58 adult testis samples from patients with testicular germ cell tumours, including precursor carcinoma in situ (CIS), infertility or Klinefelter syndrome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The expression patterns of DLK1, INSL3, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor 2 (COUP-TFII), cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP11A1) and smooth muscle actin (SMA) were investigated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. The percentage of positive LCs was estimated and correlated to total LC numbers and serum levels of reproductive hormones.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: DLK1, INSL3 and COUP-TFII expression changed during normal development and was linked to different stages of LC differentiation: DLK1 was expressed in all fetal LCs, but only in spindle-shaped progenitor cells and in a small subset of polygonal LCs in the normal adult testis; INSL3 was expressed in a subset of fetal LCs, but in the majority of adult LCs; and COUP-TFII was expressed in peritubular and mesenchymal stroma cells at all ages, in fetal LCs early in gestation and in a subset of adult LCs. CYP11A1 was expressed in the majority of LCs regardless of age and pathology and was the best general LC marker examined here. SMA was weakly expressed in peritubular cells in the fetal and infantile testis, but strongly expressed in the adult testis. In pathological testes, the numbers of DLK1-positive interstitial cells were increased. The proportion of DLK1-positive LCs correlated with total LC numbers (R = 0.53; P {\textless} 0.001) and was higher in testis with enlargement of the peritubular layers (P {\textless} 0.01), which was also highly associated with DLK1 expression in the peritubular compartment (P {\textless} 0.001). INSL3 expression was absent in some, but not all LC micronodules, and in the majority of LCs, it was mutually exclusive of DLK1.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The number of samples was relatively small and no true normal adult controls were available. True stereology was not used for LC counting, instead LCs were counted in three fields of 0.5 µm(2) surface for each sample.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The population of LCs, especially those clustered in large nodules, are heterogeneous and comprise cells at different stages of differentiation. The study demonstrated that the differentiation and function of LCs, and possibly also peritubular cells, are impaired in adult men with testicular pathologies including testis cancer and Klinefelter syndrome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This work was funded by Rigshospitalet's research funds, the Danish Cancer Society and Kirsten and Freddy Johansen's foundation.

abstract = {The paraxial mesoderm of the somites of the vertebrate embryo contains the precursors of the axial skeleton, skeletal muscles and dermis. The Meox1 and Meox2 homeobox genes are expressed in the somites and their derivatives during embryogenesis. Mice homozygous for a null mutation in Meox1 display relatively mild defects in sclerotome derived vertebral and rib bones, whereas absence of Meox2 function leads to defective differentiation and morphogenesis of the limb muscles. By contrast, mice carrying null mutations for both Meox genes display a dramatic and wide-ranging synthetic phenotype associated with extremely disrupted somite morphogenesis, patterning and differentiation. Mutant animals lack an axial skeleton and skeletal muscles are severely deficient. Our results demonstrate that Meox1 and Meox2 genes function together and upstream of several genetic hierarchies that are required for the development of somites. In particular, our studies place Meox gene function upstream of Pax genes in the regulation of chondrogenic and myogenic differentiation of paraxial mesoderm.},

@article{Fan2016,
abstract = {Synapses are highly plastic and are modified by changes in patterns of neural activity or sensory experience. Plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses is thought to be important for learning and memory, leading to alterations in sensory representations and cognitive maps. However, these changes must be coordinated across other synapses within local circuits to preserve neural coding schemes and the organization of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, i.e., excitatory-inhibitory balance. Recent studies indicate that inhibitory synapses are also plastic and are controlled directly by a large number of neuromodulators, particularly during episodes of learning. Many modulators transiently alter excitatory-inhibitory balance by decreasing inhibition, and thus disinhibition has emerged as a major mechanism by which neuromodulation might enable long-term synaptic modifications naturally. This review examines the relationships between neuromodulation and synaptic plasticity, focusing on the induction of long-term changes that collectively enhance cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance for improving perception and behavior.

abstract = {Summary Variability in gene expression contributes to phenotypic heterogeneity even in isogenic populations. Here, we used the stereotyped, Wnt signaling-dependent development of the Caenorhabditis elegans Q neuroblast to probe endogenous mechanisms that control gene expression variability. We found that the key Hox gene that orients Q neuroblast migration exhibits increased gene expression variability in mutants in which Wnt pathway activity has been perturbed. Distinct features of the gene expression distributions prompted us on a systematic search for regulatory interactions, revealing a network of interlocked positive and negative feedback loops. Interestingly, positive feedback appeared to cooperate with negative feedback to reduce variability while keeping the Hox gene expression at elevated levels. A minimal model correctly predicts the increased gene expression variability across mutants. Our results highlight the influence of gene network architecture on expression variability and implicate feedback regulation as an effective mechanism to ensure developmental robustness.

Often these different views admit same underlying clustering of the data, so we can approach this problem by looking for clusterings that are consistent across the views, i.e., corresponding data points in each view should have same cluster membership. We propose a spectral cluster- ing framework that achieves this goal by co-regularizing the clustering hypothe- ses, and propose two co-regularization schemes to accomplish this.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The male germline transcriptome changes dramatically during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition to activate late spermatogenesis genes and to transiently suppress genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis progenitor cells, termed somatic/progenitor genes. RESULTS These changes reflect epigenetic regulation. Induction of late spermatogenesis genes during spermatogenesis is facilitated by poised chromatin established in the stem cell phases of spermatogonia, whereas silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during meiosis and postmeiosis is associated with formation of bivalent domains which also allows the recovery of the somatic/progenitor program after fertilization. Importantly, during spermatogenesis mechanisms of epigenetic regulation on sex chromosomes are different from autosomes: X-linked somatic/progenitor genes are suppressed by meiotic sex chromosome inactivation without deposition of H3K27me3. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that bivalent H3K27me3 and H3K4me2/3 domains are not limited to developmental promoters (which maintain bivalent domains that are silent throughout the reproductive cycle), but also underlie reversible silencing of somatic/progenitor genes during the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in late spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying haematopoietic lineage decisions remain disputed. Lineage-affiliated transcription factors with the capacity for lineage reprogramming, positive auto-regulation and mutual inhibition have been described as being expressed in uncommitted cell populations. This led to the assumption that lineage choice is cell-intrinsically initiated and determined by stochastic switches of randomly fluctuating cross-antagonistic transcription factors. However, this hypothesis was developed on the basis of RNA expression data from snapshot and/or population-averaged analyses. Alternative models of lineage choice therefore cannot be excluded. Here we use novel reporter mouse lines and live imaging for continuous single-cell long-term quantification of the transcription factors GATA1 and PU.1 (also known as SPI1). We analyse individual haematopoietic stem cells throughout differentiation into megakaryocytic-erythroid and granulocytic-monocytic lineages. The observed expression dynamics are incompatible with the assumption that stochastic switching between PU.1 and GATA1 precedes and initiates megakaryocytic-erythroid versus granulocytic-monocytic lineage decision-making. Rather, our findings suggest that these transcription factors are only executing and reinforcing lineage choice once made. These results challenge the current prevailing model of early myeloid lineage choice.},

abstract = {Tcte2 (t complex testes expressed 2) is a male meiosis-specific gene that maps to band 3.3 of mouse chromosome 17. Two distinct male fertility defects, hybrid sterility and transmission ratio distortion, have previously been mapped to this region. Hybrid sterility arises in crosses between different mouse species and the F1 generation males have defects in the first meiotic division and are sterile. Transmission ratio distortion is shown by males heterozygous for the t haplotype form of chromosome 17 and is a type of meiotic drive in which male gametes function unequally at fertilization. The Tcte2 gene expresses a coding mRNA and a number of putative non-ORF transcripts in meiosis I. A deletion of the 5' part of the locus abolishes Tcte2 expression on the t haplotype form of chromosome 17. Additionally, the series of putative non-ORF RNAs at the Tcte2 locus are differentially spliced in species that show hybrid sterility when crossed to laboratory mice. The identification of polymorphisms in t haplorypes and in different mouse species allows alleles of Tcte2 to be proposed as candidates for loci which contribute to both meiotic drive and hybrid sterility phenotypes. While theoretical considerations have previously been used to propose that speciation and meiotic drive involve alleles of the same genes, Tcte2 is the first cloned candidate gene to support this link at a molecular level.},

abstract = {The ability of cells to accurately control gene expression levels in response to extracellular cues is limited by the inherently stochastic nature of transcriptional regulation. A change in transcription factor (TF) activity results in changes in the expression of its targets, but the way in which cell-to-cell variability in expression (noise) changes as a function of TF activity, and whether targets of the same TF behave similarly, is not known. Here, we measure expression and noise as a function of TF activity for 16 native targets of the transcription factor Zap1 that are regulated by it through diverse mechanisms. For most activated and repressed Zap1 targets, noise decreases as expression increases. Kinetic modeling suggests that this is due to two distinct Zap1-mediated mechanisms that both change the frequency of transcriptional bursts. Notably, we found that another mechanism of repression by Zap1, which is encoded in the promoter DNA, likely decreases the size of transcriptional bursts, producing a unique transcriptional state characterized by low expression and low noise. In addition, we find that further reduction in noise is achieved when a single TF both activates and represses a single target gene. Our results suggest a global principle whereby at low TF concentrations, the dominant source of differences in expression between promoters stems from differences in burst frequency, whereas at high TF concentrations differences in burst size dominate. Taken together, we show that the precise amount by which noise changes with expression is specific to the regulatory mechanism of transcription and translation that acts at each gene.},

abstract = {Regulatory T cells expressing the transcription factor Foxp3 play indispensable roles for the induction and maintenance of immunological self-tolerance and immune homeostasis. Genome-wide mRNA expression studies have defined canonical signatures of T cell subsets. Changes in steady-state mRNA levels, however, often do not reflect those of corresponding proteins due to post-transcriptional mechanisms including mRNA translation. Here, we unveil a unique translational signature, contrasting CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (T(Foxp3+)) and CD4(+)Foxp3(-) non-regulatory T (TFoxp3-) cells, which imprints subset-specific protein expression. We further show that translation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is induced during T cell activation and, in turn, regulates translation of cell cycle related mRNAs and proliferation in both T(Foxp3)- and T(Foxp3+) cells. Unexpectedly, eIF4E also affects Foxp3 expression and thereby lineage identity. Thus, mRNA-specific translational control directs both common and distinct cellular processes in CD4(+) T cell subsets.},

abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community.

Although biochemical studies indicate that N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) is the most prevalent internal modification in messenger RNA, an in-depth study of its distribution and functions has been impeded by a lack of robust analytical methods. Here we present the human and mouse m(6)A modification landscape in a transcriptome-wide manner, using a novel approach, m(6)A-seq, based on antibody-mediated capture and massively parallel sequencing. We identify over 12,000 m(6)A sites characterized by a typical consensus in the transcripts of more than 7,000 human genes. Sites preferentially appear in two distinct landmarks--around stop codons and within long internal exons--and are highly conserved between human and mouse. Although most sites are well preserved across normal and cancerous tissues and in response to various stimuli, a subset of stimulus-dependent, dynamically modulated sites is identified. Silencing the m(6)A methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression and alternative splicing patterns, resulting in modulation of the p53 (also known as TP53) signalling pathway and apoptosis. Our findings therefore suggest that RNA decoration by m(6)A has a fundamental role in regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {Diverse cell polarity networks require positive feedback for locally amplifying distributions of signalling molecules at the plasma membrane. Additional mechanisms, such as directed transport or coupled inhibitors, have been proposed to be required for reinforcing a unique axis of polarity. Here we analyse a simple model of positive feedback, with strong analogy to the 'stepping stone' model of population genetics, in which a single species of diffusible, membrane-bound signalling molecules can self-recruit from a cytoplasmic pool. We identify an intrinsic stochastic mechanism through which positive feedback alone is sufficient to account for the spontaneous establishment of a single site of polarity. We find that the polarization frequency has an inverse dependence on the number of signalling molecules: the frequency of polarization decreases as the number of molecules becomes large. Experimental observation of polarizing Cdc42 in budding yeast is consistent with this prediction. Our work suggests that positive feedback can work alone or with additional mechanisms to create robust cell polarity.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

Here we have evaluated in vitro and in vivo the requirements for the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into effector T helper cells that produce IL-17. This process required the costimulatory molecules CD28 and ICOS but was independent of the cytokines and transcription factors required for T helper type 1 or type 2 differentiation. Furthermore, both IL-4 and interferon-gamma negatively regulated T helper cell production of IL-17 in the effector phase. In vivo, antibody to IL-17 inhibited chemokine expression in the brain during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas overexpression of IL-17 in lung epithelium caused chemokine production and leukocyte infiltration. Thus, IL-17 expression characterizes a unique T helper lineage that regulates tissue inflammation.},

abstract = {What is the lineage relation among the cells of an organism? The answer is sought by developmental biology, immunology, stem cell research, brain research, and cancer research, yet complete cell lineage trees have been reconstructed only for simple organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that somatic mutations accumulated during normal development of a higher organism implicitly encode its entire cell lineage tree with very high precision. Our mathematical analysis of known mutation rates in microsatellites (MSs) shows that the entire cell lineage tree of a human embryo, or a mouse, in which no cell is a descendent of more than 40 divisions, can be reconstructed from information on somatic MS mutations alone with no errors, with probability greater than 99.95{\%}. Analyzing all approximately 1.5 million MSs of each cell of an organism may not be practical at present, but we also show that in a genetically unstable organism, analyzing only a few hundred MSs may suffice to reconstruct portions of its cell lineage tree. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by reconstructing cell lineage trees from DNA samples of a human cell line displaying MS instability. Our discovery and its associated procedure, which we have automated, may point the way to a future "Human Cell Lineage Project" that would aim to resolve fundamental open questions in biology and medicine by reconstructing ever larger portions of the human cell lineage tree.},

abstract = {During the formation of tissues, cells organize collectively by cell division and apoptosis. The multicellular dynamics of such systems is influenced by mechanical conditions and can give rise to cell rearrangements and movements. We develop a continuum description of tissue dynamics, which describes the stress distribution and the cell flow field on large scales. In the absence of division and apoptosis, we consider the tissue to behave as an elastic solid. Cell division and apoptosis introduce stress sources that, in general, are anisotropic. By combining cell number balance with dynamic equations for the stress source, we show that the tissue effectively behaves as a viscoelastic fluid with a relaxation time set by the rates of division and apoptosis. If the system is confined in a fixed volume, it reaches a homeostatic state in which division and apoptosis balance. In this state, cells undergo a diffusive random motion driven by the stochasticity of division and apoptosis. We calculate the expression for the effective diffusion coefficient as a function of the tissue parameters and compare our results concerning both diffusion and viscosity to simulations of multicellular systems using dissipative particle dynamics.},

abstract = {Cells in tissues can be morphologically indistinguishable yet show molecular expression patterns that are remarkably heterogeneous. Here we describe an approach to comprehensively identify co-regulated, heterogeneously expressed genes among cells that otherwise appear identical. The technique, called stochastic profiling, involves repeated, random selection of very small cell populations via laser-capture microdissection followed by a customized single-cell amplification procedure and transcriptional profiling. Fluctuations in the resulting gene-expression measurements are then analyzed statistically to identify transcripts that are heterogeneously coexpressed. We stochastically profiled matrix-attached human epithelial cells in a three-dimensional culture model of mammary-acinar morphogenesis. Of 4,557 transcripts, we identified 547 genes with strong cell-to-cell expression differences. Clustering of this heterogeneous subset revealed several molecular 'programs' implicated in protein biosynthesis, oxidative-stress responses and NF-kappaB signaling, which we independently confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thus, stochastic profiling can reveal single-cell heterogeneities without the need to measure expression in individual cells.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 the Owner Societies. An intuition based on deterministic models of chemical kinetics is that population heterogeneity of transcription factor levels in cells is transmitted unchanged downstream to the target genes. We use a stochastic model of a two-gene cascade with a self-regulating upstream gene to show that, counter to the intuition, there is no simple mapping (bimodal to bimodal, unimodal to unimodal) between the shapes of the distributions of transcription factor numbers and target protein numbers in cells. Due to the presence of the two regulations, the system contains two nonlinear transfer functions, defined by the Hill kinetics of transcription factor binding. The transfer function of the regulator can "interfere" with the transfer function of the target, converting the bimodal input into a unimodal output or vice versa. We show that this effect can be predicted by a geometric construction. As an example application of the method, we present a case study of a system of several downstream genes of different sensitivities, controlled by a common transcription factor which also regulates its own transcription. We show that a single regulator can induce qualitatively different patterns (binary or graded) of responses to a signal in different downstream genes, depending on whether the sensitivity regions of the transfer functions of the upstream and downstream genes overlap or not. Alternatively, the same model can be interpreted as describing a single downstream gene that has different sensitivities in different cell lines due to mutations. Our model shows, therefore, a possible kinetic mechanism by which different genes can interpret the same biological signal in a different manner.},

An acidic protein that disappeared and recovered in the same time course as spermatids after the busulfan treatment was identified as CABS1 by mass spectrometry. It was found that CABS1 was specifically expressed in the elongate spermatids at steps 13 to 16 in stages I to VIII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle of the mouse, and then it localized to the principal piece of flagellum of the mature sperm in the cauda epididymis. We have found for the first time that CABS1 is a calcium-binding protein that binds calcium during the maturation in the epididymis.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

A growing body of research on posttranscriptional gene regulation is revealing that both global protein synthesis rates and the translation of specific mRNAs are highly specialized in different cell types. How this exquisite translational regulation is achieved is the focus of this review. Two levels of regulation are discussed: the translation machinery and cis-acting elements within mRNAs. Recent evidence shows that the ribosome itself directs how the genome is translated in time and space and reveals surprising functional specificity in individual components of the core translation machinery. We are also just beginning to appreciate the rich regulatory information embedded in the untranslated regions of mRNAs, which direct the selective translation of transcripts. These hidden RNA regulons may interface with a myriad of RNA-binding proteins and specialized translation machinery to provide an additional layer of regulation to how transcripts are spatiotemporally expressed. Understanding this largely unexplored world of translational codes hardwired in the core translation machinery is an exciting new research frontier fundamental to our understanding of gene regulation, organismal development, and evolution.

In most scRNA-seq studies, only a small fraction of the transcripts present in each cell are sequenced. The efficiency, that is, the proportion of transcripts in the cell that are sequenced, can be especially low in highly parallelized experiments where the number of reads allocated for each cell is small. This leads to unreliable quantification of lowly and moderately expressed genes, resulting in extremely sparse data and hindering downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce SAVER (Single-cell Analysis Via Expression Recovery), an expression recovery method for scRNA-seq that borrows information across genes and cells to impute the zeros as well as to improve the expression estimates for all genes. We show, by comparison to RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and by data down-sampling experiments, that SAVER reliably recovers cell-specific gene expression concentrations, cross-cell gene expression distributions, and gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlations. This improves the power and accuracy of any downstream analysis involving genes with low to moderate expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Histones and histone variants are essential components of the nuclear chromatin. While mass spectrometry has opened a large window to their characterization and functional studies, their identification from proteomic data remains challenging. Indeed, the current interpretation of mass spectrometry data relies on public databases which are either not exhaustive (Swiss-Prot) or contain many redundant entries (UniProtKB or NCBI). Currently, no protein database is ideally suited for the analysis of histones and the complex array of mammalian histone variants. RESULTS We propose two proteomics-oriented manually curated databases for mouse and human histone variants. We manually curated {\textgreater}1700 gene, transcript and protein entries to produce a non-redundant list of 83 mouse and 85 human histones. These entries were annotated in accordance with the current nomenclature and unified with the "HistoneDB2.0 with Variants" database. This resource is provided in a format that can be directly read by programs used for mass spectrometry data interpretation. In addition, it was used to interpret mass spectrometry data acquired on histones extracted from mouse testis. Several histone variants, which had so far only been inferred by homology or detected at the RNA level, were detected by mass spectrometry, confirming the existence of their protein form. CONCLUSIONS Mouse and human histone entries were collected from different databases and subsequently curated to produce a non-redundant protein-centric resource, MS{\_}HistoneDB. It is dedicated to the proteomic study of histones in mouse and human and will hopefully facilitate the identification and functional study of histone variants.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of immunology was largely defined in laboratory mice, partly because they are inbred and genetically homogeneous, can be genetically manipulated, allow kinetic tissue analyses to be carried out from the onset of disease, and permit the use of tractable disease models. Comparably reductionist experiments are neither technically nor ethically possible in humans. However, there is growing concern that laboratory mice do not reflect relevant aspects of the human immune system, which may account for failures to translate disease treatments from bench to bedside. Laboratory mice live in abnormally hygienic specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier facilities. Here we show that standard laboratory mouse husbandry has profound effects on the immune system and that environmental changes produce mice with immune systems closer to those of adult humans. Laboratory mice--like newborn, but not adult, humans--lack effector-differentiated and mucosally distributed memory T cells. These cell populations were present in free-living barn populations of feral mice and pet store mice with diverse microbial experience, and were induced in laboratory mice after co-housing with pet store mice, suggesting that the environment is involved in the induction of these cells. Altering the living conditions of mice profoundly affected the cellular composition of the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulted in global changes in blood cell gene expression to patterns that more closely reflected the immune signatures of adult humans rather than neonates, altered resistance to infection, and influenced T-cell differentiation in response to a de novo viral infection. These data highlight the effects of environment on the basal immune state and response to infection and suggest that restoring physiological microbial exposure in laboratory mice could provide a relevant tool for modelling immunological events in free-living organisms, including humans.},

abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such asRNA-Sequencing(RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. How- ever, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes.

abstract = {All organisms have elaborate mechanisms to control rates of protein production. However, protein production is also subject to stochastic fluctuations, or "noise." Several recent studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli have investigated the relationship between transcription and translation rates and stochastic fluctuations in protein levels, or more generally, how such randomness is a function of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, the fundamental question of whether stochasticity in protein expression is generally biologically relevant has not been addressed, and it remains unknown whether random noise in the protein production rate of most genes significantly affects the fitness of any organism. We propose that organisms should be particularly sensitive to variation in the protein levels of two classes of genes: genes whose deletion is lethal to the organism and genes that encode subunits of multiprotein complexes. Using an experimentally verified model of stochastic gene expression in S. cerevisiae, we estimate the noise in protein production for nearly every yeast gene, and confirm our prediction that the production of essential and complex-forming proteins involves lower levels of noise than does the production of most other genes. Our results support the hypothesis that noise in gene expression is a biologically important variable, is generally detrimental to organismal fitness, and is subject to natural selection.},

abstract = {Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.},

abstract = {It is well established that immune responses are diminished in the old. However, we still do not have a clear understanding of what dictates the dysfunction of old T cells at the molecular level. Although microarray analysis has been used to compare young and old T cells, identifying hundreds of genes that are differentially expressed among these populations, it has been difficult to utilize this information to pinpoint which biological pathways truly affect the function of aged T cells. To better define differences between young and old na{\"{i}}ve CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, microarray analysis was performed pre- and post-TCR stimulation for 4, 12, 24 and 72 h. Our data indicate that many genes are differentially expressed in the old compared to the young at all five time points. These genes encode proteins involved in multiple cellular functions such as cell growth, cell cycle, cell death, inflammatory response, cell trafficking, etc. Additionally, the information from this microarray analysis allowed us to underline both intrinsic deficiencies and defects in signaling only seen after activation, such as pathways involving T-cell signaling, cytokine production, and Th2 differentiation in old T cells. With the knowledge gained, we can proceed to design strategies to restore the function of old T cells. Therefore, this microarray analysis approach is a powerful and sensitive tool that reveals the extensive changes seen between young and old CD4(+) and CD8(+) na{\"{i}}ve T cells. Evaluation of these differences provides in-depth insight into potential functional and phenotypical differences among these populations.},

Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterise this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinders meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce a novel analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. Moreover, we introduce a new and robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronisation of the translational machinery in immune cells upon activation. Additionally, our approach identifies new patterns of variability across CD4+ T cell differentiation.},

We utilized two gene expression technologies to profile 48 genes in single cells at various stages during the reprogramming process. Analysis of early stages revealed considerable variation in gene expression between cells in contrast to late stages. Expression of Esrrb, Utf1, Lin28, and Dppa2 is a better predictor for cells to progress into iPSCs than expression of the previously suggested reprogramming markers Fbxo15, Fgf4, and Oct4. Stochastic gene expression early in reprogramming is followed by a late hierarchical phase with Sox2 being the upstream factor in a gene expression hierarchy. Finally, downstream factors derived from the late phase, which do not include Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Nanog, can activate the pluripotency circuitry. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We identify 13 different transcription factors, 11 of them homeodomain proteins, that act in distinct combinations in 25 different glutamatergic neuron classes to initiate and maintain eat-4/VGLUT expression. We show that the adoption of a glutamatergic phenotype is linked to the adoption of other terminal identity features of a neuron, including cotransmitter phenotypes.

It has been shown that early regionalization of the neocortex does not require thalamic inputs and is regulated by intrinsic factors. Recently, two such intrinsic factors, Pax6 and Emx2, have been identified. In this study, we identified COUP-TFI as a regulatory factor for early neocortical regionalization. The spatial and temporal expression pattern of COUP-TFI suggested a role in specification of the neocortex and in maintaining cortical identity. Altered region-specific expression of marker genes in the cortex as well as miswired area-specific connections between the cortex and the thalamus in COUP-TFI null mice indicate COUP-TFI plays a critical role in regulating early regionalization. Our results substantiate that COUP-TFI, an intrinsic factor, may work in concert with Pax6 and Emx2 to specify neocortical identity.},

However, clinical outcomes vary and many ascribe inconsistency to the tissue source of MSCs. Yet unconsidered is the extent of heterogeneity of individual MSCs from a given tissue source with respect to differentiation potential and immune regulatory function. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional diversity of murine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. We found genes associated with MSC multipotency were expressed at a high level and with consistency between individual cells. However, genes associated with osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, neurogenic and vascular smooth muscle differentiation were expressed at widely varying levels between individual cells. Further, certain genes associated with immunomodulation were also inconsistent between individual cells. Differences could not be ascribed to cycles of proliferation, culture bias or other cellular process, which might alter transcript expression in a regular or cyclic pattern. These results support and extend the concept of lineage priming of MSCs and emphasize caution for in vivo or clinical use of MSCs, even when immunomodulation is the goal, since multiple mesodermal (and even perhaps ectodermal) outcomes are a possibility. Purification might enable shifting of the probability of a certain outcome, but is unlikely to remove multilineage potential altogether.},

Recent integrated experimental and modelling studies have shed light on the molecular sources of this variability. However, many of these studies focus on systems that have reached a steady state and therefore do not address a large class of dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression. Here we develop a general protocol for analysing and predicting stochastic gene expression in systems that never reach steady states. We use this framework to analyse experimentally stochastic expression of genes driven by the Synechococcus elongatus circadian clock. We find that, although the average expression at two points in the circadian cycle separated by 12 hours is identical, the variability at these two time points can be different. We show that this is a general feature of out-of-steady-state systems. We demonstrate how intrinsic noise sources, owing to random births and deaths of mRNAs and proteins, or extrinsic noise sources, which introduce fluctuations in rate constants, affect the cell-to-cell variability. To distinguish experimentally between these sources, we measured how the correlation between expression fluctuations of two identical genes is modulated during the circadian cycle. This quantitative framework is generally applicable to any out-of-steady-state system and will be necessary for understanding the fidelity of dynamic cellular systems.},

We tested this hypothesis directly by measuring age-specific variability in gene expression. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of six genes in various inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster unexpectedly failed to show an increase in variability among individuals as they age and die. Although regulation of gene expression is a central feature of life, a global decline in the control of gene expression does not appear to be either a cause or a consequence of the process of aging.},

abstract = {Aging is a major risk factor for chronic disease in the human population, but there are little human data on gene expression alterations that accompany the process. We examined human peripheral blood leukocyte in-vivo RNA in a large-scale transcriptomic microarray study (subjects aged 30-104 years). We tested associations between probe expression intensity and advancing age (adjusting for confounding factors), initially in a discovery set (n= 58), following-up findings in a replication set (n=240). We confirmed expression of key results by real-time PCR. Of 16,571 expressed probes, only 295 (2{\%}) were robustly associated with age. Just six probes were required for a highly efficient model for distinguishing between young and old (area under the curve in replication set; 95{\%}). The focused nature of age-related gene expression may therefore provide potential biomarkers of aging. Similarly, only 7 of 1065 biological or metabolic pathways were age-associated, in gene set enrichment analysis, notably including the processing of messenger RNAs (mRNAs); [P{\textless}0.002, false discovery rate (FDR) q{\textless}0.05]. This is supported by our observation of age-associated disruption to the balance of alternatively expressed isoforms for selected genes, suggesting that modification of mRNA processing may be a feature of human aging.},

abstract = {As the ability to analyze individual cells in microbial populations expands, it is becoming apparent that isogenic microbial populations contain substantial cell-to-cell differences in physiological parameters such as growth rate, resistance to stress and regulatory circuit output. Subpopulations exist that are manyfold different in these parameters from the population average, and these differences arise by stochastic processes. Such differences can dramatically affect the response of cells to perturbations, especially stress, which in turn dictates overall population response. Defining the role of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in population behavior is important for understanding population-based research problems, including those involving infecting populations, normal flora and bacterial populations in water and soils. Emerging technological breakthroughs are poised to transform single-cell analysis and are critical for the next phase of insights into physiological heterogeneity in the near future. These include technologies for multiparameter analysis of live cells, with downstream processing and analysis.},

@article{Moretti2016,
abstract = {Background: During meiosis, the X and Y chromosomes are transcriptionally silenced. The persistence of repressive chromatin marks on the sex chromatin after meiosis initially led to the assumption that XY gene silencing persists to some extent in spermatids. Considering the many reports of XY-linked genes expressed and needed in the post-meiotic phase of mouse spermatogenesis, it is still unclear whether or not the mouse sex chromatin is a repressive or permissive environment, after meiosis. Results: To determine the transcriptional and chromatin state of the sex chromosomes after meiosis, we re-analyzed ten ChIP-Seq datasets performed on mouse round spermatids and four RNA-seq datasets from male germ cells purified at different stages of spermatogenesis. For this, we used the last version of the genome (mm10/GRCm38) and included reads that map to several genomic locations in order to properly interpret the high proportion of sex chromosome-encoded multicopy genes. Our study shows that coverage of active epigenetic marks H3K4me3 and Kcr is similar on the sex chromosomes and on autosomes. The post-meiotic sex chromatin nevertheless differs from autosomal chromatin in its enrichment in H3K9me3 and its depletion in H3K27me3 and H4 acetylation. We also identified a posttranslational modification, H3K27ac, which specifically accumulates on the Y chromosome. In parallel, we found that the X and Y chromosomes are enriched in genes expressed post-meiotically and display a higher proportion of spermatid-specific genes compared to autosomes. Finally, we observed that portions of chromosome 14 and of the sex chromosomes share specific features, such as enrichment in H3K9me3 and the presence of multicopy genes that are specifically expressed in round spermatids, suggesting that parts of chromosome 14 are under the same evolutionary constraints than the sex chromosomes. Conclusions: Based on our expression and epigenomic studies, we conclude that, after meiosis, the mouse sex chromosomes are no longer silenced but are nevertheless regulated differently than autosomes and accumulate different chromatin marks. We propose that post-meiotic selective constraints are at the basis of the enrichment of spermatid-specific genes and of the peculiar chromatin composition of the sex chromosomes and of parts of chromosome 14. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Tumor heterogeneity is a major barrier to effective cancer diagnosis and treatment. We recently identified cancer-specific differentially DNA-methylated regions (cDMRs) in colon cancer, which also distinguish normal tissue types from each other, suggesting that these cDMRs might be generalized across cancer types. Here we show stochastic methylation variation of the same cDMRs, distinguishing cancer from normal, in colon, lung, breast, thyroid, and Wilms tumors, with intermediate variation in adenomas. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing shows these variable cDMRs are related to loss of sharply delimited methylation boundaries at CpG islands. Furthermore, we find hypomethylation of discrete blocks encompassing half the genome, with extreme gene expression variability. Genes associated with the cDMRs and large blocks are involved in mitosis and matrix remodeling, respectively. These data suggest a model for cancer involving loss of epigenetic stability of well-defined genomic domains that underlies increased methylation variability in cancer and could contribute to tumor heterogeneity.

abstract = {Nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin, have a critical role in the control of gene expression. Nucleosome positions have generally been determined by examining bulk populations of cells and then correlated with overall gene expression. Here, we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning in single cells by virtue of the ability of the nucleosome to protect DNA from GpC methylation. In the acid phosphatase inducible PHO5 gene, we find that there is significant cell-to-cell variation in nucleosome positions and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. However, nucleosome positioning is not absolute, and even with major shifts in gene expression, some cells fail to change nucleosome configuration. Mutations of the PHO5 promoter that introduce a poly(dA:dT) tract-stimulated gene expression under nonpermissive conditions led to shifts of positioned nucleosomes similar to induction of PHO5. By contrast, mutations that altered AA/TT/AT periodicity reduced gene expression upon PHO5 induction and stabilized nucleosomes in most cells, suggesting that enhanced nucleosome affinity for DNA antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined nucleosome positioning in two regions described as "fuzzy" or nucleosome-free when examined in a bulk assay. These regions consisted of distinct nucleosomes with a larger footprint for potential location and an increase population of cells lacking a nucleosome altogether. These data indicate an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning that may contribute to the flexibility and heterogeneity of gene expression.},

abstract = {Author Summary A critical event in mammalian embryo development is construction of a mass of embryonic stem cells surrounded by a distinct shell that later forms the placenta along with other structures. Despite sustained investigation, multiple hypotheses for what is responsible for this organization persist and it remains unclear what is responsible for the robust organization (remarkable ability for embryos to pattern correctly) of these structures. Here, we utilize multi-scale, stochastic modeling along with fluorescence imaging to investigate the factors that contribute to the incredible robustness of this organizational process. Results point to two factors that contribute to this robustness: 1) the timing and pace of cell fate specification and 2) stochastic gene regulatory effects. The former creates a window of time during which each cell can continually read their environment and adjust their gene expressions (and consequently fate) in response to dynamic rearrangements of cells arising from cell divisions and motions. The latter improves cell plasticity, providing the capability for cells to adjust to changes in their local environment. Fluorescence imaging results demonstrate that the magnitude and structure of gene expression variations match those predicted to promote organizational robustness.},

STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels.

abstract = {Throughout the reproductive lifespan of most male mammals, sperm production is constant because of the regulated differentiation of spermatogonia. Retinoic acid (RA) and a downstream target, Stra8, are required for complete spermatogenesis. To examine the role of RA in initiating spermatogonial differentiation, a transgenic mouse model expressing beta-galactosidase under the control of an RA response element was used. Cells in the neonatal testis undergoing active RA signaling were visualized by beta-galactosidase activity, the relationship between RA and differentiation determined, and the role of RA-degrading enzymes in regulating RA demonstrated. Beta-galactosidase activity was found to be predominantly associated with differentiating, premeiotic germ cells and to be distributed nonuniformly throughout the seminiferous tubules. Additionally, beta-galactosidase activity in premeiotic germ cells colocalized with STRA8 protein and was induced in germ cells with exogenous RA treatment. The RA-degrading enzyme, CYP26B1, was found to have germ cell localization and nonuniform distribution between tubules via immunohistochemistry. Treatment with a CYP26 enzyme inhibitor resulted in an increased number of germ cells with both beta-galactosidase activity and STRA8 protein and an increase in the expression of genes associated with differentiation and reduced expression of a gene associated with undifferentiated germ cells. These results show the action of RA in a subset of spermatogonia leads to nonuniform initiation of differentiation throughout the neonatal testis, potentially mediated through the action of CYP26 enzymes. Thus, the presence of RA is a likely driving factor in the initiation of spermatogonial differentiation and may result in asynchronous spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {Direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be achieved by overexpression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc transcription factors, but only a minority of donor somatic cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency. Here we demonstrate that reprogramming by these transcription factors is a continuous stochastic process where almost all mouse donor cells eventually give rise to iPS cells on continued growth and transcription factor expression. Additional inhibition of the p53/p21 pathway or overexpression of Lin28 increased the cell division rate and resulted in an accelerated kinetics of iPS cell formation that was directly proportional to the increase in cell proliferation. In contrast, Nanog overexpression accelerated reprogramming in a predominantly cell-division-rate-independent manner. Quantitative analyses define distinct cell-division-rate-dependent and -independent modes for accelerating the stochastic course of reprogramming, and suggest that the number of cell divisions is a key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.},

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {Mass cytometry or CyTOF is an emerging technology for high-dimensional multiparameter single cell analysis that overcomes many limitations of fluorescence-based flow cytometry. New methods for analyzing CyTOF data attempt to improve automation, scalability, performance, and interpretation of data generated in large studies. However, most current tools are less suitable for routine use where analysis must be standardized, reproducible, interpretable, and comparable. Assigning individual cells into discrete groups of cell types (gating) involves time-consuming sequential manual steps untenable for larger studies. The subjectivity of manual gating introduces variability into the data and impacts reproducibility and comparability of results, particularly in multi-center studies. The FlowCAP consortium was formed to address these issues and it aims to boost user confidence in the viability of automated gating methods. We introduce DeepCyTOF, a standardization approach for gating based on a multi-autoencoder neural network. DeepCyTOF requires labeled cells from only a single sample. It is based on domain adaptation principles and is a generalization of previous work that allows us to calibrate between a source domain distribution (reference sample) and multiple target domain distributions (target samples) in a supervised manner. We apply DeepCyTOF to two CyTOF datasets generated from primary immune blood cells: (i) 14 subjects with a history of infection with West Nile virus (WNV), and (ii) 34 healthy subjects of different ages. Each blood sample was labeled with 42 antibody markers, 12 of which were used in our analysis, at baseline and three different stimuli (PMA/ionomycin, tumor cell line K562, and infection with WNV). In each of these datasets we manually gated a single baseline reference sample to automatically gate the remaining uncalibrated samples. We show that DeepCyTOF cell classification is highly concordant with cell classification obtained by individual manual gating of each sample with over 99{\%} concordance. Additionally, we apply a stacked autoencoder, which is one of the building blocks of DeepCyTOF, to cytometry datasets used in the 4th challenge of the FlowCAP-I competition and demonstrate that it over performs relative to all gating methods introduced in this competition. We conclude that stacked autoencoders combined with a domain adaptation procedure offers a powerful computational approach for semi-automated gating of CyTOF and flow cytometry data such that manual gating of one reference sample is sufficient for accurately gating the remaining samples.},

Microbiologists are rapidly gaining a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in these behaviours, and the underlying genetic regulation. Such behaviours are also interesting from the perspective of social evolution ? why do microorganisms engage in these behaviours given that cooperative individuals can be exploited by selfish cheaters, who gain the benefit of cooperation without paying their share of the cost? There is great potential for interdisciplinary research in this fledgling field of sociomicrobiology, but a limiting factor is the lack of effective communication of social evolution theory to microbiologists. Here, we provide a conceptual overview of the different mechanisms through which cooperative behaviours can be stabilized, emphasizing the aspects most relevant to microorganisms, the novel problems that microorganisms pose and the new insights that can be gained from applying evolutionary theory to microorganisms.},

Here, we characterize the phylogenetic turnover of poly-adenylated transcripts in a comprehensive sampling of taxa of the mouse (genus Mus), spanning a phylogenetic distance of 10 Myr. Using deep RNA sequencing we find that at a given sequencing depth transcriptome coverage becomes saturated within a taxon, but keeps extending when compared between taxa, even at this very shallow phylogenetic level. Our data show a high turnover of transcriptional states between taxa and that no major transcript-free islands exist across evolutionary time. This suggests that the entire genome can be transcribed into poly-adenylated RNA when viewed at an evolutionary time scale. We conclude that any part of the non-coding genome can potentially become subject to evolutionary functionalization via de novo gene evolution within relatively short evolutionary time spans.},

abstract = {In microorganisms, noise in gene expression gives rise to cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

To define the contribution of DNA methylation to heterogeneity within tumors, we performed genome-scale bisulfite sequencing of 104 primary chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs). Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories.},

At single-base resolution we discovered extensive, previously undetected DNA methylation, identified the context and level of methylation at each site, and observed local sequence effects upon methylation state. Deep sequencing of smRNAs revealed a direct relationship between the location of smRNAs and DNA methylation, perturbation of smRNA biogenesis upon loss of CpG DNA methylation, and a tendency for smRNAs to direct strand-specific DNA methylation in regions of RNA-DNA homology. Finally, strand-specific mRNA-seq revealed altered transcript abundance of hundreds of genes, transposons, and unannotated intergenic transcripts upon modification of the DNA methylation state. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It is difficult to predict the rate of the transition between two cell fates due to the strong effect of noise on feedback loops and missing parameters. We opened synthetic positive feedback loops experimentally to obtain open-loop functions. These functions allowed us to identify a deterministic model of bistability by bypassing noise and the requirement to resolve individual processes in the loop. Combining the open-loop function with kinetic measurements and reintroducing the measured noise, we were able to predict the transition rates for the feedback systems without parameter tuning. Noise in gene expression was the key determinant of the transition rates inside the bistable range. Transitions between two cell fates were also observed outside of the bistable range, evidenced by bimodality and hysteresis. In this case, a slow transient process was the rate-limiting step in the transitions. Thus, feedback opening is an effective approach to identify the determinants of cell fate transitions and to predict their rates.},

Here, we demonstrate production of the steroid pregnenolone by Th2 cells in vitro and in vivo in a helminth infection model. Single-cell RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR analysis suggest that pregnenolone synthesis in Th2 cells is related to immunosuppression. In support of this, we show that pregnenolone inhibits Th cell proliferation and B cell immunoglobulin class switching. We also show that steroidogenic Th2 cells inhibit Th cell proliferation in a Cyp11a1 enzyme-dependent manner. We propose pregnenolone as a "lymphosteroid," a steroid produced by lymphocytes. We speculate that this de novo steroid production may be an intrinsic phenomenon of Th2-mediated immune responses to actively restore immune homeostasis.},

However, the underlying relationship and mechanisms among these processes remain unclear. Here we systematically dissected these features along developmental progression using mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and single-cell RNA sequencing with allelic resolution. We found that mESCs grown in a ground state 2i condition displayed transcriptomic profiles diffused from preimplantation mouse embryonic cells, while EpiStem cells closely resembled the postimplantaion epiblast. Sex-related gene expression varied greatly across distinct developmental states. We also identified novel markers that were highly enriched in each developmental state. Moreover, we revealed that several novel pathways including PluriNetWork and Focal Adhesion were responsible for the delayed progression of female EpiStem cells. Importantly, we 'digitalized' XCI progression using allelic expression of active and inactive X Chromosomes and surprisingly found that XCI states exhibited profound variability in each developmental state including the 2i condition. XCI progression was not tightly synchronized with loss of pluripotency and increase of differentiation at the single-cell level although these processes were globally correlated. In addition, highly expressed genes, including core pluripotency factors, were in general biallelically expressed. Taken together, our study sheds light on the dynamics of XCI progression and the asynchronicity between pluripotency, differentiation and XCI.},

abstract = {Within the bone marrow, stem cells differentiate and give rise to diverse blood cell types and functions. Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with in vivo differentiation potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively map myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups, showing unexpected transcriptional priming toward seven differentiation fates but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting that the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with early transcriptional priming, while traditional transplantation experiments suggest that in vivo priming may still allow for plasticity given strong perturbations. These data establish a reference model and general framework for studying hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution.},

abstract = {Vestimentiferan tubeworms are marine invertebrates that inhabit chemosynthetic environments, and although recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested that vestimentiferan tubeworms are derived from polychaete annelids, they show some morphological features that are different from other polychaetes. For example, vestimentiferans lack a digestive tract and have less body segments and comparative neuroanatomy can provide essential insight into the vestimentiferan body plan and its evolution. In the present study, we investigated the adult nervous system in the vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia satsuma using antibodies against synapsin, serotonin, FMRMamide and acetylated $\alpha$-tubulin. We also examined the expressions of neural marker genes, elav and synaptotagmin to reveal the distribution of neuronal cell bodies. Brain anatomy shows simple organization in Lamellibrachia compared to other polychaetes. This simplification is probably due to the loss of the digestive tract, passing through the body between the brain and the subesophageal ganglion. In contrast, the ventral nerve cord shows a repeated organizational structure as in the other polychaetes, despite the absence of the multiple segmentation of the trunk. These results suggest that the brain anatomy is variable depending on the function and the condition of surrounding tissues, and that the formation of the rope ladder-like nervous system of the ventral nerve cord is independent from segmentation in polychaetes.},

abstract = {Motivation: Current microarray analyses focus on identifying sets of genes that are differentially expressed (DE) or differentially coexpressed (DC) in different biological states (e.g. diseased versus non-diseased). We observed that in many human diseases, some genes have a significantincrease or decrease in expression variability (variance). Asthese observed changes in expression variability may be caused by alteration of the underlying expression dynamics, such differential variability (DV) patterns are also biologically interesting.Results: Here we propose a novel analysis for changes in gene expression variability between groups of amples, which we call differential variability analysis. We introduce the concept of differential variability (DV), and present a simple procedure for identifying DV genes from microarray data. Our procedure is evaluated with simulated and real microarray datasets. The effect of data preprocessing methods on identification of DV gene is investigated. The biological significance of DV analysis is demonstrated with four human disease datasets. The relationships among DV, DE and DC genes are investigated. The results suggest that changes in expression variability are associated with changes in coexpression pattern, which imply that DV is not merely stochastic noise, but informative signal.Availability: The R source code for differential variability analysis is available from the contact authors upon request.Contact: joshua@it.usyd.edu.au; mcharleston@it.usyd.edu.au},

Although essential to cell viability and development3–5, the exact role of m6A modification remains to be determined. The recent discovery of two m6A demethylases in mammalian cells highlighted the importance of m6A in basic biological functions and disease6–8. Here we show that m6A is selectively recognized by the human YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) protein to regulate mRNA degradation. We identified over 3,000 cellular RNA targets of YTHDF2, most of which are mRNAs, but which also include non-coding RNAs, with a conserved core motif of G(m6A)C. We further establish the role of YTHDF2 in RNA metabolism, showing that binding of YTHDF2 results in the localization of bound mRNA from the translatable pool to mRNA decay sites, such as processing bodies9. The C-terminal domain of YTHDF2 selectively binds to m6A-containing mRNA whereas the N-terminal domain is responsible for the localization of the YTHDF2-mRNA complex to cellular RNA decay sites. Our results indicate that the dynamic m6A modification is recognized by selective-binding proteins to affect the translation status and lifetime of mRNA.},

abstract = {Gene expression shows a significant variation (noise) between genetically identical cells. Noise depends on the gene expression process regulated by the chromatin environment. We screened for chromatin factors that modulate noise in S. cerevisiae and analyzed the results using a theoretical model that infers regulatory mechanisms from the noise versus mean relationship. Distinct activities of the Rpd3(L) and Set3 histone deacetylase complexes were predicted. Both HDACs repressed expression. Yet, Rpd3(L)C decreased the frequency of transcriptional bursts, while Set3C decreased the burst size, as did H2B monoubiquitination (ubH2B). We mapped the acetylation of H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) upon deletion of multiple subunits of Set3C and Rpd3(L)C and of ubH2B effectors. ubH2B and Set3C appear to function in the same pathway to reduce the probability that an elongating PolII produces a functional transcript (PolII processivity), while Rpd3(L)C likely represses gene expression at a step preceding elongation. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Numerous microarray studies of aging have been conducted, yet given the noisy nature of gene expression changes with age, elucidating the transcriptional features of aging and how these relate to physiological, biochemical and pathological changes remains a critical problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of age-related gene expression profiles using 27 datasets from mice, rats and humans. Our results reveal several common signatures of aging, including 56 genes consistently overexpressed with age, the most significant of which was APOD, and 17 genes underexpressed with age. We characterized the biological processes associated with these signatures and found that age-related gene expression changes most notably involve an overexpression of inflammation and immune response genes and of genes associated with the lysosome. An underexpression of collagen genes and of genes associated with energy metabolism, particularly mitochondrial genes, as well as alterations in the expression of genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle and cellular senescence biomarkers, were also observed. By employing a new method that emphasizes sensitivity, our work further reveals previously unknown transcriptional changes with age in many genes, processes and functions. We suggest these molecular signatures reflect a combination of degenerative processes but also transcriptional responses to the process of aging. Overall, our results help to understand how transcriptional changes relate to the process of aging and could serve as targets for future studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://genomics.senescence.info/uarrays/signatures.html.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {The torrent of RNA-seq data becoming available not only furnishes an overview of the entire transcriptome but also provides tools to focus on specific areas of interest. Our focus on the synthesis of ribosomes asked whether the abundance of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs) matched the equimolar need for the RPs in the assembly of ribosomes. We were at first surprised to find, in the mapping data of ENCODE and other sources, that there were nearly 100-fold differences in the level of the mRNAs encoding the different RPs. However, after correcting for the mapping ambiguities introduced by the presence of more than 2000 pseudogenes derived from RP mRNAs, we show that for 80{\%}-90{\%} of the RP genes, the molar ratio of mRNAs varies less than threefold, with little tissue specificity. Nevertheless, since the RPs are needed in equimolar amounts, there must be sluggish or regulated translation of the more abundant RP mRNAs and/or substantial turnover of unused RPs. In addition, seven of the RPs have subsidiary genes, three of which are pseudogenes that have been "rescued" by the introduction of promoters and/or upstream introns. Several of these are transcribed in a tissue-specific manner, e.g., RPL10L in testis and RPL3L in muscle, leading to potential variation in ribosome structure from one tissue to another. Of the 376 introns in the RP genes, a single one is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner.},

We emphasize how SRM can generate molecular maps of protein complexes and extract quantitative information on the number, size, distribution, and spatial organization of macromolecules. We discuss both the novel information that can be generated through SRM as well as the experimental considerations to examine while conducting such studies. With the increasing popularity of SRM in the biological sciences, this review will serve as a tool to navigate the range of applications and harness the power of SRM to elucidate biological structures. SRM methods allow access to a new realm of structural information in cells at different levels of molecular organization from the nanometer to the micrometer resolution regime.Quantitative SRM can provide information on single molecules and their stoichiometry in oligomers, such as proteins in membrane-bound complexes or multimeric enzymes.The generation of molecular maps via SRM provides an in-depth view of the architecture and spatial arrangement of proteins in supramolecular assemblies, including endosomes, focal adhesions, centrosomes, and synaptic structures.Correlative SRM and electron microscopy (EM) is emerging as a powerful technique which harnesses the superior resolution of EM with the specificity of SRM.},

Nevertheless, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that maintain the defining characteristics of neurons following their initial postmitotic specification. Using conditional gene ablation in mice, we demonstrate here that the homeodomain protein LIM homeobox (Lhx)7 is essential for maintaining the morphological and molecular characteristics of cholinergic interneurons of the striatum. Lhx7-depleted cholinergic interneurons extinguish expression of several subtype-specific markers, including choline acetyl transferase and Isl1, and are respecified into Lhx6-expressing mature GABAergic interneurons. Additional expression studies support a model where Lhx7 controls the choice between cholinergic or GABAergic identity by gating a cross inhibitory regulation between Isl1 and Lhx6. By demonstrating that the switch between alternative striatal interneuron fates depends on persistent activity of a single transcription factor, we provide evidence that the intrinsic plasticity of mammalian forebrain neuronal subtypes is maintained after the initial specification and lineage commitment and possibly throughout life.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell expression variation (CEV) is a prevalent feature of even well-defined cell populations, but its functions, particularly at the organismal level, are not well understood. Using single-cell data obtained via high-dimensional flow cytometry of T cells as a model, we introduce an analysis framework for quantifying CEV in primary cell populations and studying its functional associations in human cohorts. Analyses of 840 CEV phenotypes spanning multiple baseline measurements of 14 proteins in 28 T cell subpopulations suggest that the quantitative extent of CEV can exhibit substantial subject-to-subject differences and yet remain stable within healthy individuals over months. We linked CEV to age and disease-associated genetic polymorphisms, thus implicating CEV as a biomarker of aging and disease susceptibility and suggesting that it might play an important role in health and disease. Our dataset, interactive figures, and software for computing CEV with flow cytometry data provide a resource for exploring CEV functions.},

abstract = {When a single cell senses a chemical gradient and chemotaxes, stochastic receptor-ligand binding can be a fundamental limit to the cell's accuracy. For clusters of cells responding to gradients, however, there is a critical difference: even genetically identical cells have differing responses to chemical signals. With theory and simulation, we show collective chemotaxis is limited by cell-to-cell variation in signaling. We find that when different cells cooperate the resulting bias can be much larger than the effects of ligand-receptor binding. Specifically, when a strongly-responding cell is at one end of a cell cluster, cluster motion is biased toward that cell. These errors are mitigated if clusters average measurements over times long enough for cells to rearrange. In consequence, fluid clusters are better able to sense gradients: we derive a link between cluster accuracy, cell-to-cell variation, and the cluster rheology. Because of this connection, increasing the noisiness of individual cell motion can actually increase the collective accuracy of a cluster by improving fluidity.},

abstract = {In yeast, the transcription factor Crz1 is dephosphorylated and translocates into the nucleus in response to extracellular calcium. Here we show, using time-lapse microscopy, that Crz1 exhibits short bursts of nuclear localization (typically lasting 2 min) that occur stochastically in individual cells and propagate to the expression of downstream genes. Strikingly, calcium concentration controls the frequency, but not the duration, of localization bursts. Using an analytic model, we also show that this frequency modulation of bursts ensures proportional expression of multiple target genes across a wide dynamic range of expression levels, independent of promoter characteristics. We experimentally confirm this theory with natural and synthetic Crz1 target promoters. Another stress-response transcription factor, Msn2, exhibits similar, but largely uncorrelated, localization bursts under calcium stress suggesting that frequency-modulation regulation of localization bursts may be a general control strategy used by the cell to coordinate multi-gene responses to external signals.},

Here, we observe that when NF-$\kappa$B oscillations are entrained by periodic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inputs in experiments, NF-$\kappa$B exhibits jumps between frequency modes, a phenomenon we call “cellular mode-hopping.” By comparing stochastic simulations of NF-$\kappa$B oscillations to deterministic simulations conducted inside and outside the chaotic regime of parameter space, we show that noise facilitates mode-hopping in all regimes. However, when the deterministic system is driven by chaotic dynamics, hops between modes are erratic and short-lived, whereas in experiments, the system spends several periods in one entrainment mode before hopping and rarely visits more than two modes. The experimental behavior matches our simulations of noise-induced mode-hopping outside the chaotic regime. We suggest that mode-hopping is a mechanism by which different NF-$\kappa$B-dependent genes under frequency control can be expressed at different times.},

For adipocytes, key regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, the renewal rate is only 10{\%} per year. We used computational modeling, quantitative mass spectrometry, and single-cell microscopy to show that cell-to-cell variability, or noise, in protein abundance acts within a network of more than six positive feedbacks to permit pre-adipocytes to differentiate at very low rates. This reconciles two fundamental opposing requirements: High cell-to-cell signal variability is needed to generate very low differentiation rates, whereas low signal variability is needed to prevent differentiated cells from de-differentiating. Higher eukaryotes can thus control low rates of near irreversible cell fate decisions through a balancing act between noise and ultrahigh feedback connectivity.},

abstract = {To study in vivo CD8 T cell differentiation, we quantified the coexpression of multiple genes in single cells throughout immune responses. After in vitro activation, CD8 T cells rapidly express effector molecules and cease their expression when the antigen is removed. Gene behavior after in vivo activation, in contrast, was quite heterogeneous. Different mRNAs were induced at very different time points of the response, were transcribed during different time periods, and could decline or persist independently of the antigen load. Consequently, distinct gene coexpression patterns/different cell types were generated at the various phases of the immune responses. During primary stimulation, inflammatory molecules were induced and down-regulated shortly after activation, generating early cells that only mediated inflammation. Cytotoxic T cells were generated at the peak of the primary response, when individual cells simultaneously expressed multiple killer molecules, whereas memory cells lost killer capacity because they no longer coexpressed killer genes. Surprisingly, during secondary responses gene transcription became permanent. Secondary cells recovered after antigen elimination were more efficient killers than cytotoxic T cells present at the peak of the primary response. Thus, primary responses produced two transient effector types. However, after boosting, CD8 T cells differentiate into long-lived killer cells that persist in vivo in the absence of antigen.},

abstract = {Populations of genetically identical eukaryotic cells show significant cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. However, we lack a good understanding of the origins of this variation. We have found marked cell-to-cell variability in average cellular rates of transcription. We also found marked cell-to-cell variability in the amount of cellular mitochondrial mass. We undertook fusion studies that suggested that variability in transcription rate depends on small diffusible factors. Following this, in vitro studies showed that transcription rate has a sensitive dependence on [ATP] but not on the concentration of other nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs). Further experiments that perturbed populations by changing nutrient levels and available [ATP] suggested this connection holds in vivo. We found evidence that cells with higher mitochondrial mass, or higher total membrane potential, have a faster rate of transcription per unit volume of nuclear material. We also found evidence that transcription rate variability is substantially modulated by the presence of anti- or prooxidants. Daughter studies showed that a cause of variability in mitochondrial content is apparently stochastic segregation of mitochondria at division. We conclude by noting that daughters that stochastically inherit a lower mitochondrial mass than their sisters have relatively longer cell cycles. Our findings reveal a link between variability in energy metabolism and variability in transcription rate.},

Due to technological limitations, most studies to date have focused on differences in mean expression across experimental conditions, rather than differences in gene expression variance. The advent of single cell RNA sequencing has now made it feasible to study gene expression heterogeneity and to characterise genes based on their coefficient of variation. Methods: We collected single cell gene expression profiles for 32 human and 39 mouse embryonic stem cells and studied correlation between diverse characteristics such as network connectivity and coefficient of variation (CV) across single cells. We further systematically characterised properties unique to High CV genes. Results: Highly expressed genes tended to have a low CV and were enriched for cell cycle genes. In contrast, High CV genes were co-expressed with other High CV genes, were enriched for bivalent (H3K4me3 and H3K27me3) marked promoters and showed enrichment for response to DNA damage and DNA repair. Conclusions: Taken together, this analysis demonstrates the divergent characteristics of genes based on their CV. High CV genes tend to form co-expression clusters and they explain bivalency at least in part.},

abstract = {The apical organ of ciliated larvae of cnidarians and bilaterians is a true larval organ that disappears before or at metamorphosis. It appears to be sensory, probably involved in metamorphosis, but knowledge is scant. The ciliated protostome larvae show ganglia/nerve cords that are retained as the adult central nervous system (CNS). Two structures can be recognized, viz. a pair of cerebral ganglia, which form the major part of the adult brain, and a blastoporal (circumblastoporal) nerve cord, which becomes differentiated into a perioral loop, paired or secondarily fused ventral nerve cords and a small perianal loop. The anterior loop becomes part of the brain. This has been well documented through cell-lineage studies in a number of spiralians, and homologies with similar structures in the ecdysozoans are strongly indicated. The deuterostomes are generally difficult to interpret, and the nervous systems of echinoderms and enteropneusts appear completely enigmatic. The ontogeny of the chordate CNS can perhaps be interpreted as a variation of the ontogeny of the blastoporal nerve cord of the protostomes, and this is strongly supported by patterns of gene expression. The presence of 'deuterostomian' blastopore fates both in an annelid and in a mollusk, which are both placed in families with the 'normal' spiralian gastrulation type, and in the chaetognaths demonstrates that the chordate type of gastrulation could easily have evolved from the spiralian type. This indicates that the latest common ancestor of the deuterostomes was very similar to the latest common pelago-benthic ancestor of the protostomes as described by the trochaea theory, and that the neural tube of the chordates is morphologically ventral.},

abstract = {Gene expression is significantly stochastic making modeling of genetic networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially slower than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the promoter fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if promoter fluctuations are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The discovery of novel biological knowledge from the ab initio analysis of post-genomic data relies upon the use of unsupervised processing methods, in particular clustering techniques. Much recent research in bioinformatics has therefore been focused on the transfer of clustering methods introduced in other scientific fields and on the development of novel algorithms specifically designed to tackle the challenges posed by post-genomic data. The partitions returned by a clustering algorithm are commonly validated using visual inspection and concordance with prior biological knowledge--whether the clusters actually correspond to the real structure in the data is somewhat less frequently considered. Suitable computational cluster validation techniques are available in the general data-mining literature, but have been given only a fraction of the same attention in bioinformatics. RESULTS: This review paper aims to familiarize the reader with the battery of techniques available for the validation of clustering results, with a particular focus on their application to post-genomic data analysis. Synthetic and real biological datasets are used to demonstrate the benefits, and also some of the perils, of analytical clustervalidation.

We present a novel computational method, called GiniClust, to overcome this challenge. Validation against a benchmark dataset indicates that GiniClust achieves high sensitivity and specificity. Application of GiniClust to public single-cell RNA-seq datasets uncovers previously unrecognized rare cell types, including Zscan4-expressing cells within mouse embryonic stem cells and hemoglobin-expressing cells in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. GiniClust also correctly detects a small number of normal cells that are mixed in a cancer cell population.},

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.},

abstract = {Vertebrate gastrulation involves the speci{\textregistered}cation and coordinated movement of large populations of cells that give rise to the ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal germ layers. Although many of the genes involved in the speci{\textregistered}cation of cell identity during this process have been identi{\textregistered}ed, little is known of the genes that coordinate cell movement. Here we show that the zebra{\textregistered}sh silberblick (slb) locus1 encodes Wnt11 and that Slb/ Wnt11 activity is required for cells to undergo correct convergentextension movements during gastrulation. In the absence of Slb/ Wnt11 function, abnormal extension of axial tissue results in cyclopia and other midline defects in the head2. The requirement for Slb/Wnt11 is cell non-autonomous, and our results indicate that the correct extension of axial tissue is at least partly depen- dent on medio-lateral cell intercalation in paraxial tissue. We also show that the slb phenotype is rescued by a truncated form of Dishevelled that does not signal through the canonical Wnt pathway3, suggesting that, as in ̄ies4, Wnt signalling might mediate morphogenetic events through a divergent signal trans- duction cascade. Our results provide genetic and experimental evidence that Wnt activity in lateral tissues has a crucial role in driving the convergent extension movements underlying verte- brate gastrulation.},

abstract = {The switch from mitosis to meiosis is a unique feature of germ cell development. In mammals, meiotic initiation requires retinoic acid (RA), which activates meiotic inducers, including Stra8, but how the switch to meiosis is controlled in male germ cells (spermatogonia) remains poorly understood. Here we examine the role of the Doublesex-related transcription factor DMRT1 in adult spermatogenesis using conditional gene targeting in the mouse. Loss of Dmrt1 causes spermatogonia to precociously exit the spermatogonial program and enter meiosis. Therefore, DMRT1 determines whether male germ cells undergo mitosis and spermatogonial differentiation or meiosis. Loss of Dmrt1 in spermatogonia also disrupts cyclical gene expression in Sertoli cells. DMRT1 acts in spermatogonia to restrict RA responsiveness, directly repress Stra8 transcription, and activate transcription of the spermatogonial differentiation factor Sohlh1, thereby preventing meiosis and promoting spermatogonial development. By coordinating spermatogonial development and mitotic amplification with meiosis, DMRT1 allows abundant, continuous production of sperm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

In contrast, exit from pluripotency and lineage commitment have not been studied systematically at the single-cell level. Here we measured the gene expression dynamics of retinoic acid driven mESC differentiation using an unbiased single-cell transcriptomics approach. We found that the exit from pluripotency marks the start of a lineage bifurcation as well as a transient phase of susceptibility to lineage specifying signals. Our study revealed several transcriptional signatures of this phase, including a sharp increase of gene expression variability. Importantly, we observed a handover between two classes of transcription factors. The early-expressed class has potential roles in lineage biasing, the late-expressed class in lineage commitment. In summary, we provide a comprehensive analysis of lineage commitment at the single cell level, a potential stepping stone to improved lineage control through timing of differentiation cues.},

abstract = {The mammalian X and Y chromosomes share little homology and are largely unsynapsed during normal meiosis. This asynapsis triggers inactivation of X- and Y-linked genes, or meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) [1]. Whether MSCI is essential for male meiosis is unclear. Pachytene arrest and apoptosis is observed in mouse mutants in which MSCI fails, e.g., Brca1-/-, H2afx-/-, Sycp1-/-, and Msh5-/- [2, 3]. However, these also harbor defects in synapsis and/or recombination and as such may activate a putative pachytene checkpoint [4]. Here we present evidence that MSCI failure is sufficient to cause pachytene arrest. XYY males exhibit Y-Y synapsis and Y chromosomal escape from MSCI without accompanying synapsis/recombination defects [5]. We find that XYY males, like synapsis/recombination mutants, display pachytene arrest and that this can be circumvented by preventing Y-Y synapsis and associated Y gene expression. Pachytene expression of individual Y genes inserted as transgenes on autosomes shows that expression of the Zfy1/2 paralogs in XY males is sufficient to phenocopy the pachytene arrest phenotype; insertion of Zfy1/2 on the X chromosome where they are subject to MSCI prevents this response. Our findings show that MSCI is essential for male meiosis and, as such, provide insight into the differential severity of meiotic mutations' effects on male and female meiosis. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The establishment of correct neurotransmitter characteristics is an essential step of neuronal fate specification in CNS development. However, very little is known about how a battery of genes involved in the determination of a specific type of chemical-driven neurotransmission is coordinately regulated during vertebrate development. Here, we investigated the gene regulatory networks that specify the cholinergic neuronal fates in the spinal cord and forebrain, specifically, spinal motor neurons (MNs) and forebrain cholinergic neurons (FCNs). Conditional inactivation of Isl1, a LIM homeodomain factor expressed in both differentiating MNs and FCNs, led to a drastic loss of cholinergic neurons in the developing spinal cord and forebrain. We found that Isl1 forms two related, but distinct types of complexes, the Isl1-Lhx3-hexamer in MNs and the Isl1-Lhx8-hexamer in FCNs. Interestingly, our genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis revealed that the Isl1-Lhx3-hexamer binds to a suite of cholinergic pathway genes encoding the core constituents of the cholinergic neurotransmission system, such as acetylcholine synthesizing enzymes and transporters. Consistently, the Isl1-Lhx3-hexamer directly coordinated upregulation of cholinergic pathways genes in embryonic spinal cord. Similarly, in the developing forebrain, the Isl1-Lhx8-hexamer was recruited to the cholinergic gene battery and promoted cholinergic gene expression. Furthermore, the expression of the Isl1-Lhx8-complex enabled the acquisition of cholinergic fate in embryonic stem cell-derived neurons. Together, our studies show a shared molecular mechanism that determines the cholinergic neuronal fate in the spinal cord and forebrain, and uncover an important gene regulatory mechanism that directs a specific neurotransmitter identity in vertebrate CNS development.},

abstract = {Approximately unbiased tests based on bootstrap probabilities are considered for the exponential family of distributions with unknown expectation parameter vector, where the null hypothesis is represented as an arbitrary-shaped region with smooth boundaries. This problem has been discussed previously in Efron and Tibshirani [Ann. Statist. 26 (1998) 1687-1718], and a corrected p-value with second-order asymptotic accuracy is calculated by the two-level bootstrap of Efron, Halloran and Holmes [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93 (1996) 13429-13434] based on the ABC bias correction of Efron [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 82 (1987) 171-185]. Our argument is an extension of their asymptotic theory, where the geometry, such as the signed distance and the curvature of the boundary, plays an important role. We give another calculation of the corrected p-value without finding the ``nearest point'' on the boundary to the observation, which is required in the two-level bootstrap and is an implementational burden in complicated problems. The key idea is to alter the sample size of the replicated dataset from that of the observed dataset. The frequency of the replicates falling in the region is counted for several sample sizes, and then the p-value is calculated by looking at the change in the frequencies along the changing sample sizes. This is the multiscale bootstrap of Shimodaira [Systematic Biology 51 (2002) 492-508], which is third-order accurate for the multivariate normal model. Here we introduce a newly devised multistep-multiscale bootstrap, calculating a third-order accurate p-value for the exponential family of distributions.},

abstract = {Phenotypic variation is ubiquitous in biology and is often traceable to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression "noise," has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

@article{Richard2016,
abstract = {In some recent studies, a view emerged that stochastic dynamics governing the switching of cells from one differentiation state to another could be characterized by a peak in gene expression variability at the point of fate commitment. We have tested this hypothesis at the single-cell level by analyzing primary chicken erythroid progenitors through their differentiation process and measuring the expression of selected genes at six sequential time-points after induction of differentiation. In contrast to population-based expression data, single-cell gene expression data revealed a high cell-to-cell variability, which was masked by averaging. We were able to show that the correlation network was a very dynamical entity and that a subgroup of genes tend to follow the predictions from the dynamical network biomarker (DNB) theory. In addition, we also identified a small group of functionally related genes encoding proteins involved in sterol synthesis that could act as the initial drivers of the differentiation. In order to assess quantitatively the cell-to-cell variability in gene expression and its evolution in time, we used Shannon entropy as a measure of the heterogeneity. Entropy values showed a significant increase in the first 8 h of the differentiation process, reaching a peak between 8 and 24 h, before decreasing to significantly lower values. Moreover, we observed that the previous point of maximum entropy precedes two paramount key points: an irreversible commitment to differentiation between 24 and 48 h followed by a significant increase in cell size variability at 48 h. In conclusion, when analyzed at the single cell level, the differentiation process looks very different from its classical population average view. New observables (like entropy) can be computed, the behavior of which is fully compatible with the idea that differentiation is not a “simple” program that all cells execute identically but results from the dynamical behavior of the underlying molecular network.},

abstract = {While neuronal cell types display an astounding degree of phenotypic diversity, most if not all neuron types share a core panel of terminal features. However, little is known about how pan-neuronal expression patterns are genetically programmed. Through an extensive analysis of the cis-regulatory control regions of a battery of pan-neuronal C. elegans genes, including genes involved in synaptic vesicle biology and neuropeptide signaling, we define a common organizational principle in the regulation of pan-neuronal genes in the form of a surprisingly complex array of seemingly redundant, parallel-acting cis-regulatory modules that direct expression to broad, overlapping domains throughout the nervous system. These parallel-acting cis-regulatory modules are responsive to a multitude of distinct trans-acting factors. Neuronal gene expression programs therefore fall into two fundamentally distinct classes. Neuron-type-specific genes are generally controlled by discrete and non-redundantly acting regulatory inputs, while pan-neuronal gene expression is controlled by diverse, coincident and seemingly redundant regulatory inputs. The authors show that the expression of pan-neuronal genes is controlled by a common organizational principle, characterized by redundant, parallel-acting cis-regulatory modules. This functional organization is strikingly distinct from the control of neuron-type-specific genes.},

abstract = {Cell migration is one of the earliest events required for development of the testis. Migration occurs only in XY gonads downstream of Sry expression and is required for the subsequent epithelialization of testis cords. Using organ culture experiments and tissue recombination, we and others speculated that peritubular myoid (PTM) cells were among the migratory cells and were likely the cell type required for cord formation. However, because no unique marker was found for PTM cells, their positive identification during or after migration remained unclear. alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (alphaSma; approved gene symbol Acta2), a classic marker of adult PTM cells,is expressed broadly in testis interstitial cells at E12.5, and becomes highly enriched in PTM cells by E15.5-16.5. We used a novel transgenic line expressingEYFP under the control of an alphaSma promoter to determine whether alphaSma-EYFP positive cellsmigrate into the gonad. Surprisingly, mesonephroi expressing alphaSma-EYFP do not contribute any EYFP positive cells to XY gonads when used as donors in recombination cultures. These results indicate that alphaSma-EYFP cells do not migrate into the gonad during the critical window of sex determination and cannot be the migrating cell type required for testis cord formation. Our results suggest that PTM cells, and most other interstitial lineages, with the exception of endothelial cells, are induced within the gonad. These experiments suggest that endothelial cells are the migrating cell type required for epithelialization of testis cords.},

abstract = {When encountering foreign antigens, na??ve T cells become activated and differentiate into effector and memory T cells. They represent therefore the primary source to mount an immune response against pathogens or tumors. Recent evidence of both quantitative and qualitative alterations of na??ve T cells has accumulated in aged mice, indicating that the successful generation of primary T cell responses from the na??ve T cell pool may be compromised with old age. However, the vast majority of the data supporting compromised na??ve T cell priming efficacy with old age have been produced in animal models, and the situation is much less clear in humans. In the elderly, the involution of the thymus and the associated decline in thymic output result in a decreased number of na??ve T cells, which is partially compensated by homeostatic proliferation. Emerging evidence suggest that alterations of the TCR repertoire diversity and intrinsic defects of old CD4+ na??ve T cells may impact on their responsiveness to antigenic stimulation. Increasing focus on the study of na??ve T cells (in particular CD8+) in old humans are needed to fill the gaps in our understanding of reduced cellular immunity with aging. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite an overall fast turnover of TF binding locations between species, we identified thousands of TF regions of highly constrained TF binding intensity. Although individual mutations in bound sequence motifs can influence TF binding, most binding differences occur in the absence of nearby sequence variations. Instead, combinatorial binding was found to be significant for genetic and evolutionary stability; cobound TFs tend to disappear in concert and were sensitive to genetic knockout of partner TFs. The large, qualitative differences in genomic regions bound between closely related mammals, when contrasted with the smaller, quantitative TF binding differences among Drosophila species, illustrate how genome structure and population genetics together shape regulatory evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Cell differentiation is typically directed by external signals that drive opposing regulatory pathways. Studying differentiation under polarizing conditions, with only one input signal provided, is limited in its ability to resolve the logic of interactions between opposing pathways. Dissection of this logic can be facilitated by mapping the system's response to mixtures of input signals, which are expected to occur in vivo, where cells are simultaneously exposed to various signals with potentially opposing effects. Here, we systematically map the response of nave T cells to mixtures of signals driving differentiation into the Th1 and Th2 lineages. We characterize cell state at the single cell level by measuring levels of the two lineage-specific transcription factors (T-bet and GATA3) and two lineage characteristic cytokines (IFN-c and IL-4) that are driven by these transcription regulators. We find a continuum of mixed phenotypes in which individual cells co-express the two lineage-specific master regulators at levels that gradually depend on levels of the two input signals. Using mathematical modeling we show that such tunable mixed phenotype arises if autoregulatory positive feedback loops in the gene network regulating this process are gradual and dominant over cross-pathway inhibition. We also find that expression of the lineage-specific cytokines follows two independent stochastic processes that are biased by expression levels of the master regulators. Thus, cytokine expression is highly heterogeneous under mixed conditions, with subpopulations of cells expressing only IFN-c, only IL-4, both cytokines, or neither. The fraction of cells in each of these subpopulations changes gradually with input conditions, reproducing the continuous internal state at the cell population level. These results suggest a differentiation scheme in which cells reflect uncertainty through a continuously tuneable mixed phenotype combined with a biased stochastic decision rather than a binary phenotype with a deterministic decision.},

The molecular mechanisms enabling bet-hedging have remained elusive. Here, we review how HIV makes a bet-hedging decision between active replication and proviral latency, a long-lived dormant state that is the chief barrier to an HIV cure. The discovery of a virus-encoded bet-hedging circuit in HIV revealed an ancient evolutionary role for latency and identified core regulatory principles, such as feedback and stochastic 'noise', that enable cell-fate decisions. These core principles were later extended to fate selection in stem cells and cancer, exposed new therapeutic targets for HIV, and led to a potentially broad strategy of using 'noise modulation' to redirect cell fate.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells exposed to the same environment display variability in gene expression (noise), with important consequences for the fidelity of cellular regulation and biological function. Although population average gene expression is tightly coupled to growth-rate, the effects of changes in environmental conditions on expression variability are not known. Here, we measure the single-cell expression distributions of {\~{}}900 S. cerevisiae promoters across four environmental conditions using flow cytometry, and find that gene expression noise is tightly coupled to the environment and is generally higher at lower growth rates. Nutrient-poor conditions, which support lower growth rates, display elevated levels of noise for most promoters, regardless of their specific expression values. We present a simple model of noise in expression that results from having an asynchronous population, with cells at different cell cycle stages, and with different partitioning of the cells between the stages at different growth rates. This model predicts non-monotonic global changes in noise at different growth rates as well as overall higher noise for cell cycle regulated genes in all conditions. The consistency between this model and our data, as well as with noise measurements of cells growing in a chemostat at well-defined growth rates, suggests that cell-cycle heterogeneity is a major contributor to gene expression noise.

Our results show the existence of growth-related global changes in gene expression noise and suggest their potential phenotypic implications in noise-driven processes, such as persistence, survival after treatment and responsiveness to fluctuating environments.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that older adults may be a sensitive population with regard to environmental exposure to toxic compounds. One source of this sensitivity could be an enhanced variability in response. Studies on phenotypic differences have suggested that variation in response does increase with age. However, few reports address the question of variation in gene expression as an underlying cause for increased variability of phenotypic response in the aged. In this study, we utilized global analysis to compare variation in constitutive gene expression in the retinae of young (4 months), middle-aged (11 months), and aged (23 months) Fischer 344 rats. Three hundred and forty transcripts were identified in which variance in expression increased from 4 to 23 months of age, while only 12 transcripts were found for which it decreased. Functional roles for identified genes were clustered in basic biological categories including cell communication, function, metabolism, and response to stimuli. Our data suggest that population stochastically induced variability should be considered in assessing sensitivity due to old age.},

Both innate and adaptive immune responses as well as the development and maintenance of the cells and tissues that comprise the immune system are, at multiple steps, under the control of the NF-$\kappa$B family of transcription factors. Although this is a well-studied area of NF-$\kappa$B research, new and significant findings continue to accumulate.

Here, we show that the murine Suv39h histone methyltransferases (HMTases) govern H3-K9 methylation at pericentric heterochromatin and induce a specialized histone methylation pattern that differs from the broad H3-K9 methylation present at other chromosomal regions. Suv39h-deficient mice display severely impaired viability and chromosomal instabilities that are associated with an increased tumor risk and perturbed chromosome interactions during male meiosis. These in vivo data assign a crucial role for pericentric H3-K9 methylation in protecting genome stability, and define the Suv39h HMTases as important epigenetic regulators for mammalian development.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Transcription factors that drive neuron type-specific terminal differentiation programs in the developing nervous system are often expressed in several distinct neuronal cell types, but to what extent they have similar or distinct activities in individual neuronal cell types is generally not well explored. We investigate this problem using, as a starting point, the C. elegans LIM homeodomain transcription factor ttx-3, which acts as a terminal selector to drive the terminal differentiation program of the cholinergic AIY interneuron class. Using a panel of different terminal differentiation markers, including neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes, neurotransmitter receptors and neuropeptides, we show that ttx-3 also controls the terminal differentiation program of two additional, distinct neuron types, namely the cholinergic AIA interneurons and the serotonergic NSM neurons. We show that the type of differentiation program that is controlled by ttx-3 in different neuron types is specified by a distinct set of collaborating transcription factors. One of the collaborating transcription factors is the POU homeobox gene unc-86, which collaborates with ttx-3 to determine the identity of the serotonergic NSM neurons. unc-86 in turn operates independently of ttx-3 in the anterior ganglion where it collaborates with the ARID-type transcription factor cfi-1 to determine the cholinergic identity of the IL2 sensory and URA motor neurons. In conclusion, transcription factors operate as terminal selectors in distinct combinations in different neuron types, defining neuron type-specific identity features.},

Animals were killed at 2-day intervals from 2 to 42 days postpartum and at 48, 64, 72, 93 and 100 days postpartum. Testicular, cauda epididymis and vas deferens cell suspensions were stained with the metachromatic fluorochrome acridine orange and measured by flow cytometry for red and green fluorescence levels after excitation by blue laser light. Intensities of red and green fluorescence reflect amounts of single- and double-strand nucleic acid sites available for acridine orange staining, respectively, and were used to classify cells on the basis of ploidy level, RNA content, and chromatin structure, as defined by susceptibility to acid denaturation of DNA in situ. Sperm from cauda epididymis and vas deferens were examined by light microscopy to determine frequency of abnormal sperm head morphology. Fluorescence data derived from acridine orange-stained testicular cells quantified the sequential changes in 1) proportions of haploid, diploid and tetraploid cell types during the first round of spermatogenesis, and 2) proportions of round, elongating, and elongated spermatids during the first round of spermiogenesis. Ratios of the three major testicular populations (haploid, diploid, and tetraploid) reached adult levels by 48 days postpartum. Sperm cells were first detected in the cauda epididymis and vas deferens on 30 and 36 days postpartum, respectively. Early sperm populations, compared to adult sperm, exhibited up to 89{\%} abnormalities in sperm head morphology that correlated with significant levels of abnormal chromatin structure. Percentage of sperm head abnormalities and chromatin structure in the cauda epididymis and vas deferens approached normal adult levels by 42 and 48 days postpartum, respectively.},

abstract = {Cell fate choice and commitment of multipotent progenitor cells to a differentiated lineage requires broad changes of their gene expression profile. But how progenitor cells overcome the stability of their gene expression configuration (attractor) to exit the attractor in one direction remains elusive. Here we show that commitment of blood progenitor cells to the erythroid or myeloid lineage is preceded by the destabilization of their high-dimensional attractor state, such that differentiating cells undergo a critical state transition. Single-cell resolution analysis of gene expression in populations of differentiating cells affords a new quantitative index for predicting critical transitions in a high-dimensional state space based on decrease of correlation between cells and concomitant increase of correlation between genes as cells approach a tipping point. The detection of "rebellious cells" that enter the fate opposite to the one intended corroborates the model of preceding destabilization of a progenitor attractor. Thus, early warning signals associated with critical transitions can be detected in statistical ensembles of high-dimensional systems, offering a formal theory-based approach for analyzing single-cell molecular profiles that goes beyond current computational pattern recognition, does not require knowledge of specific pathways, and could be used to predict impending major shifts in development and disease.},

A key stage in meiosis is the synapsis of maternal and paternal homologous chromosomes, accompanied by exchange of genetic material to generate crossovers.

This process, meiotic silencing, is conserved in all mammals studied to date, but its purpose is not yet defined. Here, I review the molecular genetics of meiotic silencing and consider the many potential functions that it could serve in the mammalian germ line. In addition, I discuss how meiotic silencing influences sex differences in meiotic infertility and the profound impact that meiotic silencing has had on the evolution of mammalian sex chromosomes.},

abstract = {Genomic instability and alterations in gene expression are hallmarks of eukaryotic aging. The yeast histone deacetylase Sir2 silences transcription and stabilizes repetitive DNA, but during aging or in response to a DNA break, the Sir complex relocalizes to sites of genomic instability, resulting in the desilencing of genes that cause sterility, a characteristic of yeast aging. Using embryonic stem cells, we show that mammalian Sir2, SIRT1, represses repetitive DNA and a functionally diverse set of genes across the mouse genome. In response to DNA damage, SIRT1 dissociates from these loci and relocalizes to DNA breaks to promote repair, resulting in transcriptional changes that parallel those in the aging mouse brain. Increased SIRT1 expression promotes survival in a mouse model of genomic instability and suppresses age-dependent transcriptional changes. Thus, DNA damage-induced redistribution of SIRT1 and other chromatin-modifying proteins may be a conserved mechanism of aging in eukaryotes. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sexual reproduction crucially depends on the production of sperm in males and oocytes in females. Both types of gamete arise from the same precursor, the germ cells. We review the events that characterize the development of germ cells during fetal life as they commit to, and prepare for, oogenesis or spermatogenesis. In females, fetal germ cells enter meiosis, whereas in males they delay meiosis and instead lose pluripotency, activate an irreversible program of prospermatogonial differentiation, and temporarily cease dividing. Both pathways involve sex-specific molecular signals from the somatic cells of the developing gonads and a suite of intrinsic receptors, signal transducers, transcription factors, RNA stability factors, and epigenetic modulators that act in complex, interconnected positive and negative regulatory networks. Understanding these networks is important in the contexts of the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of infertility and gonadal cancers, and in efforts to augment human and animal fertility using stem cell approaches.

abstract = {Bet hedging-stochastic switching between phenotypic states-is a canonical example of an evolutionary adaptation that facilitates persistence in the face of fluctuating environmental conditions. Although bet hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, direct evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking. Here we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however, in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor. The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions to life in fluctuating environments},

Time-lapse microscopy techniques are beginning to provide a direct view of circuit dynamics in individual living cells. Unexpectedly, we are discovering that key transcription and regulatory factors pulse on and off repeatedly, and often stochastically, even when cells are maintained in constant conditions. This type of spontaneous dynamic behavior is pervasive, appearing in diverse cell types from microbes to mammalian cells. Here, we review recent work showing how pulsing is generated and controlled by underlying regulatory circuits and how it provides critical capabilities to cells in stress response, signaling, and development. A major theme is the ability of pulsing to enable time-based regulation analogous to strategies used in engineered systems. Thus, pulsatile dynamics is emerging as a central, and still largely unexplored, layer of temporal organization in the cell.},

abstract = {By profiling the transcriptomes of individual cells, single-cell RNA sequencing provides unparalleled resolution to study cellular heterogeneity. However, this comes at the cost of high technical noise, including cell-specific biases in capture efficiency and library generation. One strategy for removing these biases is to add a constant amount of spike-in RNA to each cell and to scale the observed expression values so that the coverage of spike-in transcripts is constant across cells. This approach has previously been criticized as its accuracy depends on the precise addition of spike-in RNA to each sample. Here, we perform mixture experiments using two different sets of spike-in RNA to quantify the variance in the amount of spike-in RNA added to each well in a plate-based protocol. We also obtain an upper bound on the variance due to differences in behavior between the two spike-in sets. We demonstrate that both factors are small contributors to the total technical variance and have only minor effects on downstream analyses, such as detection of highly variable genes and clustering. Our results suggest that scaling normalization using spike-in transcripts is reliable enough for routine use in single-cell RNA sequencing data analyses.},

abstract = {Differentiation of na{\"{i}}ve CD4(+) T cells into functionally distinct T helper subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Due to extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis using a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of Th1 and Tfh cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous TCR sequences, we first demonstrated that Th1/Tfh bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with Th1 or Tfh fates, and demonstrated a T-cell intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting a Th1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between Th1 and IL-10-producing Tr1 cells in this infection. Th1 and Tfh fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that upregulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell in driving Th1/Tfh fates. In particular, we found that precursor Th cells were coached towards a Th1 but not a Tfh fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources, a database www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling Th1/Tfh fate commitment, and more generally, GPfates, a modelling framework for characterizing cell differentiation towards multiple fates.},

Our data reveal markedly different cell-type- and hematopoietic-lineage-specific chromatin modification patterns. Differential analysis between younger and older adults shows that aging is associated with increased heterogeneity between individuals and elevated cell-to-cell variability in chromatin modifications. Analysis of a twin cohort unveils heritability of chromatin modifications and demonstrates that aging-related chromatin alterations are predominantly driven by non-heritable influences. Together, we present a powerful platform for chromatin and immunology research. Our discoveries highlight the profound impacts of aging on chromatin modifications. A global look at human chromatin shows that variability in histone modification patterns accrues with age and depends on non-heritable factors.},

abstract = {Waddington's epigenetic landscape, a famous metaphor in developmental biology, depicts how a stem cell progresses from an undifferentiated phenotype to a differentiated one. The concept of “landscape” in the context of dynamical systems theory represents a high-dimensional space, in which each cell phenotype is considered as an “attractor” that is determined by interactions between multiple molecular players, and is buffered against environmental fluctuations. In addition, biological noise is thought to play an important role during these cell-fate decisions and in fact controls transitions between different phenotypes. Here, we discuss the phenotypic transitions in cancer from a dynamical systems perspective and invoke the concept of “cancer attractors”—hidden stable states of the underlying regulatory network that are not occupied by normal cells. Phenotypic transitions in cancer occur at varying levels depending on the context. Using epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem-like properties, metabolic reprogramming and the emergence of therapy resistance as examples, we illustrate how phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells enables them to acquire hybrid phenotypes (such as hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal and hybrid metabolic phenotypes) that tend to be more aggressive and notoriously resilient to therapies such as chemotherapy and androgen-deprivation therapy. Furthermore, we highlight multiple factors that may give rise to phenotypic plasticity in cancer cells, such as (a) multi-stability or oscillatory behaviors governed by underlying regulatory networks involved in cell-fate decisions in cancer cells, and (b) network rewiring due to conformational dynamics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that are highly enriched in cancer cells. We conclude by discussing why a therapeutic approach that promotes “recanalization”, i.e., the exit from “cancer attractors” and re-entry into “normal attractors”, is more likely to succeed rather than a conventional approach that targets individual molecules/pathways.},

abstract = {Significance$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe function of signal transduction networks is to detect changes in the extracellular environment and combine this with information on intracellular state and thereby control cell-fate decisions. Recent evidence suggests that high levels of biochemical noise in eukaryotic signaling networks interfere with information transmission, making it unclear how cell fate is correctly controlled. Here, we show that high noise levels are advantageous when a system needs to regulate the behavior of populations of cells using noisy biological signals. In contrast, when the key biological unit is a single cell, we show that the impact of noise on cellular responses is much less pronounced. Understanding how noise is generated and exploited advances our understanding of information processing in cells.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nAbstract$\backslash$r$\backslash$nSignal transduction networks allow eukaryotic cells to make decisions based on information about intracellular state and the environment. Biochemical noise significantly diminishes the fidelity of signaling: networks examined to date seem to transmit less than 1 bit of information. It is unclear how networks that control critical cell-fate decisions (e.g., cell division and apoptosis) can function with such low levels of information transfer. Here, we use theory, experiments, and numerical analysis to demonstrate an inherent trade-off between the information transferred in individual cells and the information available to control population-level responses. Noise in receptor-mediated apoptosis reduces information transfer to approximately 1 bit at the single-cell level but allows 3–4 bits of information to be transmitted at the population level. For processes such as eukaryotic chemotaxis, in which single cells are the functional unit, we find high levels of information transmission at a single-cell level. Thus, low levels of information transfer are unlikely to represent a physical limit. Instead, we propose that signaling networks exploit noise at the single-cell level to increase population-level information transfer, allowing extracellular ligands, whose levels are also subject to noise, to incrementally regulate phenotypic changes. This is particularly critical for discrete changes in fate (e.g., life vs. death) for which the key variable is the fraction of cells engaged. Our findings provide a framework for rationalizing the high levels of noise in metazoan signaling networks and have implications for the development of drugs that target these networks in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.},

For type 1 diabetes it is clear that multiple islet molecules are the target of autoimmunity in man and animal models. It is not clear whether any of the target molecules are essential for the destruction of islet beta cells. Here we show that the proinsulin/insulin molecules have a sequence that is a primary target of the autoimmunity that causes diabetes of the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. We created insulin 1 and insulin 2 gene knockouts combined with a mutated proinsulin transgene (in which residue 16 on the B chain was changed to alanine) in NOD mice. This mutation abrogated the T-cell stimulation of a series of the major insulin autoreactive NOD T-cell clones. Female mice with only the altered insulin did not develop insulin autoantibodies, insulitis or autoimmune diabetes, in contrast with mice containing at least one copy of the native insulin gene. We suggest that proinsulin is a primary autoantigen of the NOD mouse, and speculate that organ-restricted autoimmune disorders with marked major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction of disease are likely to have specific primary autoantigens.},

abstract = {There are two formalisms for mathematically describing the time behavior of a spatially homogeneous chemical system: The deterministic approach regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process which is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations (the reaction-rate equations); the stochastic approach regards the time evolution as a kind of random-walk process which is governed by a single dif- ferential-difference equation (the master equation). Fairly simple kinetic theory arguments show that the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics has a firmer physical basis than the deterministic formulation, but unfortunately the stochastic master equation is often mathematically intractable. There is, however, a way to make exact numerical calculations within the framework of the stochastic formulation without having to deal with the master equation directly. It is a relatively simple digital computer algorithm which uses a rigorously derived Monte Carlo procedure to numerically simulate the time evolution of the given chemical system. Like the master equation, this stochastic simulation algorithm correctly accounts for the inherent fluctuations and correlations that are necessarily ignored in the deterministic formulation. In addition, unlike most procedures for numerically solving the deterministic reaction-rate equations, this algorithm never approximates infinitesimal time increments dt by finite time steps At. The feasibility and utility of the simulation algorithm are demonstrated by applying it to several well-known model chemical systems, including the Lotka model, the Brusselator, and the Oregonator.},

abstract = {The multigene family encoding the five classes of replication-dependent histones has been identified from the human and mouse genome sequence. The large cluster of histone genes, HIST1, on human chromosome 6 (6p21-p22) contains 55 histone genes, and Hist1 on mouse chromosome 13 contains 51 histone genes. There are two smaller clusters on human chromosome 1: HIST2 (at 1q21), which contains six genes, and HIST3 (at 1q42), which contains three histone genes. Orthologous Hist2 and Hist3 clusters are present on mouse chromosomes 3 and 11, respectively. The organization of the human and mouse histone genes in the HIST1 cluster is essentially identical. All of the histone H1 genes are in HIST1, which is spread over about 2 Mb. There are two large gaps ({\textgreater}250 kb each) within this cluster where there are no histone genes, but many other genes. Each of the histone genes encodes an mRNA that ends in a stemloop followed by a purine-rich region that is complementary to the 5' end of U7 snRNA. In addition to the histone genes on these clusters, only two other genes containing the stem-loop sequence were identified, a histone H4 gene on human chromosome 12 (mouse chromosome 6) and the previously described H2a.X gene located on human chromosome 11. Each of the 14 histone H4 genes encodes the same protein, and there are only three histone H3 proteins encoded by the 12 histone H3 genes in each species. In contrast, both the mouse and human H2a and H2b proteins consist of at least 10 non-allelic variants, making the complexity of the histone protein complement significantly greater than previously thought.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: Hierarchical clustering is a widely used method for detecting clusters in genomic data. Clusters are defined by cutting branches off the dendrogram. A common but inflexible method uses a constant height cutoff value; this method exhibits suboptimal performance on complicated dendrograms. We present the Dynamic Tree Cut R package that implements novel dynamic branch cutting methods for detecting clusters in a dendrogram depending on their shape. Compared to the constant height cutoff method, our techniques offer the following advantages: (1) they are capable of identifying nested clusters; (2) they are flexible-cluster shape parameters can be tuned to suit the application at hand; (3) they are suitable for automation; and (4) they can optionally combine the advantages of hierarchical clustering and partitioning around medoids, giving better detection of outliers. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to protein-protein interaction network data and to a simulated gene expression data set. AVAILABILITY: The Dynamic Tree Cut method is implemented in an R package available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/BranchCutting.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

abstract = {We consider the problem of robust Bayesian inference on the mean regression function allowing the residual density to change flexibly with predictors. The proposed class of models is based on a Gaussian process prior for the mean regression function and mixtures of Gaussians for the collection of residual densities indexed by predictors. Initially considering the homoscedastic case, we propose priors for the residual density based on probit stick-breaking (PSB) scale mixtures and symmetrized PSB (sPSB) location-scale mixtures. Both priors restrict the residual density to be symmetric about zero, with the sPSB prior more flexible in allowing multimodal densities. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure strong posterior consistency in estimating the regression function under the sPSB prior, generalizing existing theory focused on parametric residual distributions. The PSB and sPSB priors are generalized to allow residual densities to change nonparametrically with predictors through incorporating Gaussian processes in the stick-breaking components. This leads to a robust Bayesian regression procedure that automatically down-weights outliers and influential observations in a locally-adaptive manner. Posterior computation relies on an efficient data augmentation exact block Gibbs sampler. The methods are illustrated using simulated and real data applications.},

Our analyses revealed a striking transcriptional divergence among cells that had undergone their first division and identified previously unknown molecular determinants that controlled the fate specification of CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Our findings suggest a model for the differentiation of terminal effector cells initiated by an early burst of transcriptional activity and subsequently refined by epigenetic silencing of transcripts associated with memory lymphocytes, which highlights the power and necessity of single-cell approaches.},

Most efforts to understand stochastic gene expression focus on local (intrinisic) fluctuations, which have an exact theoretical representation. However, no framework exists to model global (extrinsic) mechanisms of stochasticity. We address this problem by dissecting the sources of stochasticity that influence the expression of a yeast heat shock gene, SSA1. Our observations suggest that extrinsic stochasticity does not influence every step of gene expression, but rather arises specifically from cell-to-cell differences in the propensity to transcribe RNA. This led us to propose a framework for stochastic gene expression where transcription rates vary globally in combination with local, gene-specific fluctuations in all steps of gene expression. The proposed model better explains total expression stochasticity than the prevailing ON-OFF model and offers transcription as the specific mechanism underlying correlated fluctuations in gene expression.},

T-bet expression correlates with IFNgamma expression in Th1 and NK cells. Ectopic expression of T-bet both transactivates the IFNgamma gene and induces endogenous IFNgamma production. Remarkably, retroviral gene transduction of T-bet into polarized Th2 and Tc2 primary T cells redirects them into Th1 and Tc1 cells, respectively, as evidenced by the simultaneous induction of IFNgamma and repression of IL-4 and IL-5. Thus, T-bet initiates Th1 lineage development from naive Thp cells both by activating Th1 genetic programs and by repressing the opposing Th2 programs.},

abstract = {We cloned a testis-specific cDNA from mice that encodes a histone H1-like, haploid germ cell-specific nuclear protein designated HANP1/H1T2. The HANP1/H1T2 protein was specifically localized to the nuclei of murine spermatids during differentiation steps 5 to 13 but not to the nuclei of mature sperm. HANP1/H1T2 contains an arginine-serine-rich domain and an ATP/GTP binding site, and it binds to DNA, ATP, and protamine. To investigate the physiological role of HANP1/H1T2, we generated Hanp1/H1T2-disrupted mutant mice. Homozygous Hanp1/H1T2 mutant males were infertile, but females were fertile. Although a substantial number of sperm were recovered from the epididymides, their shape and function were abnormal. During sperm morphogenesis, the formation of nuclei was disturbed and protamine-1 and -2 were only weakly detectable in the nuclei. The chromatin packaging was aberrant, as demonstrated by electron microscopy and biochemical analysis. The mutant sperm exhibited deficient motility and were not competent to fertilize eggs under in vitro fertilization conditions; however, they were capable of fertilizing eggs via intracytoplasmic sperm injection that resulted in the birth of healthy progeny. Thus, we found that HANP1/H1T2 is essential for nuclear formation in functional spermatozoa and is specifically involved in the replacement of histones with protamines during spermiogenesis. At the time of submission of the manuscript, we found an independent publication by Martianov et al. (I. Martianov, S. Brancorsini, R. Catena, A. Gansmuller, N. Kotaja, M. Parvinen, P.

abstract = {Meiotic crossover formation between homologous chromosomes (homologues) entails DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, homology search using DSB ends, and synaptonemal-complex formation coupled with DSB repair. Meiotic progression must be prevented until DSB repair and homologue alignment are completed, to avoid the formation of aneuploid gametes. Here we show that mouse HORMAD1 ensures that sufficient numbers of processed DSBs are available for successful homology search. HORMAD1 is needed for normal synaptonemal-complex formation and for the efficient recruitment of ATR checkpoint kinase activity to unsynapsed chromatin. The latter phenomenon was proposed to be important in meiotic prophase checkpoints in both sexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, HORMAD1 is essential for the elimination of synaptonemal-complex-defective oocytes. Synaptonemal-complex formation results in HORMAD1 depletion from chromosome axes. Thus, we propose that the synaptonemal complex and HORMAD1 are key components of a negative feedback loop that coordinates meiotic progression with homologue alignment: HORMAD1 promotes homologue alignment and synaptonemal-complex formation, and synaptonemal complexes downregulate HORMAD1 function, thereby permitting progression past meiotic prophase checkpoints.},

abstract = {One of fundamental challenges of clustering is how to evaluate results, without auxiliary information. A common approach for evaluation of clustering results is to use validity indexes. Clustering validity approaches can use three criteria: External criteria (evaluate the result with respect to a pre-specified structure), internal criteria (evaluate the result with respect a information intrinsic to the data alone). Consequently, different types of indexes are used to solve different types of problems and indexes selection depends on the kind of available information. That is why in this paper we show a comparison between external and internal indexes. Results obtained in this study indicate that internal indexes are more accurate in group determining in a given clustering structure. Six internal indexes were used in this study: BIC, CH, DB, SIL, NIVA and DUNN and four external indexes (F-measure, NMIMeasure, Entropy, Purity). The clusters that were used were obtained through clustering algorithms K-means and Bissecting-K- means.},

Nevertheless, the question how different antigen loads are translated into appropriate IL-2 production to ensure adequate responses against pathogens remains largely unexplored. Here we find that at single cell level, IL-2 is binary (digital) and CD25 is graded expressed whereas at population level both parameters show graded expression correlating with the antigen amount. Combining in vivo data with a mathematical model we demonstrate that only this binary IL-2 expression ensures a wide linear antigen response range for Teff and Treg cells under real spatiotemporal conditions. Furthermore, at low antigen concentrations binary IL-2 expression safeguards by its spatial distribution selective STAT5 activation only of closely adjacent Treg cells regardless of their antigen specificity. These data show that the mode of IL-2 secretion is critical to tailor the adaptive immune response to the antigen amount.},

abstract = {Elucidating the role of molecular stochasticity in cellular growth is central to understanding phenotypic heterogeneity and the stability of cellular proliferation. The inherent stochasticity of metabolic reaction events should have negligible effect, because of averaging over the many reaction events contributing to growth. Indeed, metabolism and growth are often considered to be constant for fixed conditions. Stochastic fluctuations in the expression level of metabolic enzymes could produce variations in the reactions they catalyse. However, whether such molecular fluctuations can affect growth is unclear, given the various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms, the slow adjustment of key cellular components such as ribosomes, and the secretion and buffering of excess metabolites. Here we use time-lapse microscopy to measure fluctuations in the instantaneous growth rate of single cells of Escherichia coli, and quantify time-resolved cross-correlations with the expression of lac genes and enzymes in central metabolism. We show that expression fluctuations of catabolically active enzymes can propagate and cause growth fluctuations, with transmission depending on the limitation of the enzyme to growth. Conversely, growth fluctuations propagate back to perturb expression. Accordingly, enzymes were found to transmit noise to other unrelated genes via growth. Homeostasis is promoted by a noise-cancelling mechanism that exploits fluctuations in the dilution of proteins by cell-volume expansion. The results indicate that molecular noise is propagated not only by regulatory proteins but also by metabolic reactions. They also suggest that cellular metabolism is inherently stochastic, and a generic source of phenotypic heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Cellular heterogeneity, which plays an essential role in biological phenomena, such as drug resistance and migration, is considered to arise from intrinsic (i.e., reaction kinetics) and extrinsic (i.e., protein variability) noise in the cell. However, the mechanistic effects of these types of noise to determine the heterogeneity of signal responses have not been elucidated. Here, we report that the output of epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling activity is modulated by cellular noise, particularly by extrinsic noise of particular signaling components in the pathway. We developed a mathematical model of the EGF signaling pathway incorporating regulation between extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is necessary for switch-like activation of the nuclear ERK response. As the threshold of switch-like behavior is more sensitive to perturbations than the graded response, the effect of biological noise is potentially critical for cell fate decision. Our simulation analysis indicated that extrinsic noise, but not intrinsic noise, contributes to cell-to-cell heterogeneity of nuclear ERK. In addition, we accurately estimated variations in abundance of the signal proteins between individual cells by direct comparison of experimental data with simulation results using Apparent Measurement Error (AME). AME was constant regardless of whether the protein levels varied in a correlated manner, while covariation among proteins influenced cell-to-cell heterogeneity of nuclear ERK, suppressing the variation. Simulations using the estimated protein abundances showed that each protein species has different effects on cell-to-cell variation in the nuclear ERK response. In particular, variability of EGF receptor, Ras, Raf, and MEK strongly influenced cellular heterogeneity, while others did not. Overall, our results indicated that cellular heterogeneity in response to EGF is strongly driven by extrinsic noise, and that such heterogeneity results from variability of particular protein species that function as sensitive nodes, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases.},

abstract = {Male germ cell differentiation entails the synthesis and remodeling of membrane polar lipids and the formation of triacylglycerols (TAGs). This requires fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) for intracellular fatty acid traffic, a diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) to catalyze the final step of TAG biosynthesis, and a TAG storage mode. We examined the expression of genes encoding five members of the FABP family and two DGAT proteins, as well as the lipid droplet protein perilipin 2 (PLIN2), during mouse testis development and in specific cells from seminiferous epithelium. Fabp5 expression was distinctive of Sertoli cells and consequently was higher in prepubertal than in adult testis. The expression of Fabp3 increased in testis during postnatal development, associated with the functional differentiation of interstitial cells, but was low in germ cells. Fabp9, together with Fabp12, was prominently expressed in the latter. Their transcripts increased from spermatocytes to spermatids and, interestingly, were highest in spermatid-derived residual bodies (RB). Both Sertoli and germ cells, which produce neutral lipids and store them in lipid droplets, expressed Plin2. Yet, while Dgat1 was detected in Sertoli cells, Dgat2 accumulated in germ cells with a similar pattern of expression as Fabp9. These results correlated with polyunsaturated fatty acid-rich TAG levels also increasing with mouse germ cell differentiation highest in RB, connecting DGAT2 with the biosynthesis of such TAGs. The age- and germ cell type-associated increases in Fabp9, Dgat2, and Plin2 levels are thus functionally related in the last stages of germ cell differentiation.},

As most nucleosomes are replaced by protamines during spermatogenesis, it is unclear whether histone modifications function in paternal transmission of epigenetic information. Here we show that two modifications important for Trithorax- and Polycomb-mediated gene regulation have methylation-specific distributions at regulatory regions in human spermatozoa. Histone H3 Lys4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) marks genes that are relevant in spermatogenesis and cellular homeostasis. In contrast, histone H3 Lys27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) marks developmental regulators in sperm, as in somatic cells. However, nucleosomes are only moderately retained at regulatory regions in human sperm. Nonetheless, genes with extensive H3K27me3 coverage around transcriptional start sites in particular tend not to be expressed during male and female gametogenesis or in preimplantation embryos. Promoters of orthologous genes are similarly modified in mouse spermatozoa. These data are compatible with a role for Polycomb in repressing somatic determinants across generations, potentially in a variegating manner.},

Here we describe and validate a generative statistical model that accurately quantifies technical noise with the help of external RNA spike-ins. Applying our approach to investigate stochastic allele-specific expression in individual cells, we demonstrate that a large fraction of stochastic allele-specific expression can be explained by technical noise, especially for lowly and moderately expressed genes: we predict that only 17.8{\%} of stochastic allele-specific expression patterns are attributable to biological noise with the remainder due to technical noise.},

Our method generalizes variable gene selection, as used in population- and single-cell studies, to spatial expression profiles. We apply SpatialDE to Spatial Transcriptomics and to data from single cells expression profiles using multiplexed In Situ Hybridisation (SeqFISH and MERFISH), demonstrating its general use. SpatialDE identifies genes with expression patterns that are associated with histology in breast cancer tissue, several of which have known disease implications and are not detected by variable gene selection. Additionally, our model can be used to classify genes with distinct spatial patterns, including periodic expression profiles, linear trends and general spatial variation.},

abstract = {In recent years, advances in high throughput sequencing technology have led to a need for specialized methods for the analysis of digital gene expression data. While gene expression data measured on a microarray take on continuous values and can be modeled using the normal distribution, RNA sequencing data involve nonnegative counts and are more appropriately modeled using a discrete count distribution, such as the Poisson or the negative binomial. Consequently, analytic tools that assume a Gaussian distribution (such as classification methods based on linear discriminant analysis and clustering methods that use Euclidean distance) may not perform as well for sequencing data as methods that are based upon a more appropriate distribution. Here, we propose new approaches for performing classification and clustering of observations on the basis of sequencing data. Using a Poisson log linear model, we develop an analog of diagonal linear discriminant analysis that is appropriate for sequencing data. We also propose an approach for clustering sequencing data using a new dissimilarity measure that is based upon the Poisson model. We demonstrate the performances of these approaches in a simulation study, on three publicly available RNA sequencing data sets, and on a publicly available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data set.},

abstract = {The larval stages of polychaete annelids are often responsive to light and can possess one to six eyes. The early trochophore larvae of the errant annelid Platynereis dumerilii have a single pair of ventral eyespots, whereas older nectochaete larvae have an additional two pairs of dorsal eyes that will develop into the adult eyes. Early Platynereis trochophores show robust positive phototaxis starting on the first day of development. Even though the mechanism of phototaxis in Platynereis early trochophore larvae is well understood, no photopigment (opsin) expression has yet been described in this stage. In late trochophore larvae, a rhabdomeric-type opsin, r-opsin1, expressed in both the eyespots and the adult eyes has already been reported. Here, we identify another Platynereis rhabdomeric opsin, r-opsin3, that is expressed in a single photoreceptor in the eyespots in early trochophores, suggesting that it mediates early larval phototaxis. We also show that r-opsin1 and r-opsin3 are expressed in adjacent photoreceptor cells in the eyespots in later stages, indicating that a second eyespot-photoreceptor differentiates in late trochophore larvae. Using serial transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we identified and reconstructed both photoreceptors and a pigment cell in the late larval eyespot. We also characterized opsin expression in the adult eyes and found that the two opsins co-express there in several photoreceptor cells. Using antibodies recognizing r-opsin1 and r-opsin3 proteins, we demonstrate that both opsins localize to the rhabdomere in all six eyes. In addition, we found that r-opsin1 mRNA is localized to, and translated in, the projections of the adult eyes. The specific changes we describe in opsin transcription and translation and in the cellular complement suggest that the six larval eyes undergo spectral and functional maturation during the early planktonic phase of the Platynereis life cycle.},

abstract = {Defining the transcriptional dynamics of a temporal process such as cell differentiation is challenging owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Time-series gene expression analyses of bulk cells have difficulty distinguishing early and late phases of a transcriptional cascade or identifying rare subpopulations of cells, and single-cell proteomic methods rely on a priori knowledge of key distinguishing markers. Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

However, the developmental trajectories and heterogeneity of human FGCs remain largely unknown. Here we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of over 2,000 FGCs and their gonadal niche cells in female and male human embryos spanning several developmental stages. We found that female FGCs undergo four distinct sequential phases characterized by mitosis, retinoic acid signaling, meiotic prophase, and oogenesis. Male FGCs develop through stages of migration, mitosis, and cell-cycle arrest. Individual embryos of both sexes simultaneously contain several subpopulations, highlighting the asynchronous and heterogeneous nature of FGC development. Moreover, we observed reciprocal signaling interactions between FGCs and their gonadal niche cells, including activation of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and Notch signaling pathways. Our work provides key insights into the crucial features of human FGCs during their highly ordered mitotic, meiotic, and gametogenetic processes in vivo.},

abstract = {Dmrt2 is expressed in the dermomyotome of developing vertebrate somites. To determine the role of Dmrt2 during mouse embryonic development, we generated a null mutation of Dmrt2 via homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Dmrt2 heterozygous mice derived from these cells are phenotypically normal. However, Dmrt2 homozygotes die soon after birth. The cause of death is likely due to abnormal rib and sternal development, leading to an inability to breathe. Loss of Dmrt2 leads to embryonic somite patterning defects, first evidenced at embryonic day (E) 10.5 and more pronounced by E11.5. Notably, both the dermomyotome and myotome fail to adopt a normal epithelial morphology in the absence of Dmrt2. Accompanying these morphological defects are alterations in the expression patterns of dermomyotomal and myotomal transcription factors including Pax3, Paraxis, Myf5, myogenin, Mrf4 and MyoD. Despite these defects, embryos harvested from E13.5 onwards exhibited relatively normal muscle pattern and mass, suggesting that early myotomal defects are corrected by a Dmrt2-independent mechanism. Taken together, our results define an essential function for Dmrt2 in somite development and provide evidence that DM domain genes have been co-opted into other critical developmental pathways distinct from that of sex determination or differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperones the maturation of many regulatory proteins and, in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster, buffers genetic variation in morphogenetic pathways. Levels and patterns of genetic variation differ greatly between obligatorily outbreeding species such as fruitflies and self-fertilizing species such as the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Also, plant development is more plastic, being coupled to environmental cues. Here we report that, in Arabidopsis accessions and recombinant inbred lines, reducing Hsp90 function produces an array of morphological phenotypes, which are dependent on underlying genetic variation. The strength and breadth of Hsp90's effects on the buffering and release of genetic variation suggests it may have an impact on evolutionary processes. We also show that Hsp90 influences morphogenetic responses to environmental cues and buffers normal development from destabilizing effects of stochastic processes. Manipulating Hsp90's buffering capacity offers a tool for harnessing cryptic genetic variation and for elucidating the interplay between genotypes, environments and stochastic events in the determination of phenotype.},

abstract = {Spermatogonial self-renewal and differentiation are essential for male fertility and reproduction. We discovered that germ cell specific genes Sohlh1 and Sohlh2, encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcriptional regulators that are essential in spermatogonial differentiation. Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 individual mouse knockouts show remarkably similar phenotypes. Here we show that SOHLH1 and SOHLH2 proteins are co-expressed in the entire spermatogonial population except in the GFRA1+spermatogonia, which includes spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). SOHLH1 and SOHLH2 are expressed in both KIT negative and KIT positive spermatogonia, and overlap Ngn3/EGFP and SOX3 expression. SOHLH1 and SOHLH2 heterodimerize with each other in vivo, as well as homodimerize. The Sohlh1/Sohlh2 double mutant phenocopies single mutants, i.e., spermatogonia continue to proliferate but do not differentiate properly. Further analysis revealed that GFRA1+population was increased, while meiosis commenced prematurely in both single and double knockouts. Sohlh1 and Sohlh2 double deficiency has a synergistic effect on gene expression patterns as compared to the single knockouts. SOHLH proteins affect spermatogonial development by directly regulating Gfra1, Sox3 and Kit gene expression. SOHLH1 and SOHLH2 suppress genes involved in SSC maintenance, and induce genes important for spermatogonial differentiation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Much of the knowledge about cell differentiation and function in the immune system has come from studies in mice, but the relevance to human immunology, diseases, and therapy has been challenged, perhaps more from anecdotal than comprehensive evidence. To this end, we compare two large compendia of transcriptional profiles of human and mouse immune cell types. Global transcription profiles are conserved between corresponding cell lineages. The expression patterns of most orthologous genes are conserved, particularly for lineage-specific genes. However, several hundred genes show clearly divergent expression across the examined cell lineages, and among them, 169 genes did so even with highly stringent criteria. Finally, regulatory mechanisms--reflected by regulators' differential expression or enriched cis-elements--are conserved between the species but to a lower degree, suggesting that distinct regulation may underlie some of the conserved transcriptional responses.},

@article{Garrett-Bakelman2015,
abstract = {Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a clinical challenge, with most patients dying of relapsed disease. The complete biological basis of relapse remains unclear. Genetic lesions and heterogeneity have been proposed as key drivers of clinical outcome, yet do not fully explain leukemia relapse. Epigenomic dysregulation is a hallmark of newly diagnosed AML. Plasticity is a core property of the epigenome, enabling cells to adapt to stressful conditions, independent of genetic alterations. Hence we asked whether epigenomic plasticity might contribute to AML progression, have functional consequences and be independent of genetic influences in AML (a question that has not been addressed for any tumor type). Methods. We formed an international consortium to collect and profile paired diagnosis and relapse AML specimens. We extracted DNA and RNA from 138 clinically annotated AML patient samples. We obtained matched germline DNA as genetic controls, and fourteen normal CD34+ specimens as DNA methylation and transcriptome controls. We performed methylome sequencing (ERRBS), genomic sequencing (exomes and targeted resequencing) and transcriptomic (RNA-seq) profiling. For a single patient, more intensive multi-layer profiling (whole genome sequencing, ERRBS, RNA-seq and single cell RNA-seq) was performed at five serial time points. We quantified epigenetic allelic heterogeneity (epialleles) using a novel approach that employs entropy equations (MethClone), and validated epiallele composition using orthogonal methods. Some of the major conclusions are: 1) Epigenetic allelic diversity is an independent variable linked to clinical outcome. Statistically significant epiallele shift ($\Delta$S {\textless}-90) was detected at thousands of genomic loci (eloci) at diagnosis. High eloci burden correlated (Wilcoxon test) with a shorter relapse free probability in the entire cohort (p = 0.043) and in intermediate-risk patients based on the Medical Research Council (p= 0.016) and European Leukemia Net (p=0.057) criteria. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression model revealed that the epiallele burden was an independent variable correlated with relapse free survival (p = 0.021). 2) Promoter epialleles are linked to hypervariable transcriptional regulation. We observed substantial change in epiallele burden at relapse versus diagnosis. A subset of the eloci localized to gene promoters. High promoter epiallele variance was significantly associated with high transcriptional variance (p{\textless}0.001) based on RNA-seq, including genes that were significantly differentially expressed at relapse. Deconvolution of leukemia blast populations using Single Cell RNA-seq confirmed that the presence of promoter epialleles was linked to hypervariable transcriptional states (p{\textless}0.001). 3) AML patients can be classified according to epigenetic allele progression at relapse. K-means clustering based on epiallele shift at diagnosis versus relapse distributed patients into three classes: those with reduced, increasing or stable epiallele burden. Strikingly, there was no correlation between epiallele changes and the patterns of genomic evolution. Furthermore, there was no correlation between epiallele patterns acquired with mutations in epigenetic modifiers or other recurrently mutated genes in AML. 4) Epigenetic heterogeneity upon disease relapse is divergent from the genetic landscape. Integrating whole genome sequencing and methylome analysis we observed that a) significant increases in epigenetic heterogeneity precede significant changes in the abundance of somatic mutations; b) whereas a high number of somatic mutations were shared across all time points, epialleles exhibited dominance of distinct and unique eloci at each time point; and c) the variant epiallele frequency decreased earlier in progression than somatic mutation variant allele frequency, suggesting that epigenetic clonal diversification can precede genetic clonal evolution. Summary. Based on our results we propose that epigenetic allele diversity allows populations of leukemia cells to sample transcriptional states more freely thus creating the potential for greater evolutionary fitness. This provides an additional independent mechanism of plasticity that can explain the resilient nature of AML to adapt and survive exposure to chemotherapy drugs, independent of genetic heterogeneity.},

abstract = {Historically, the ribosome has been viewed as a complex ribozyme with constitutive rather than regulatory capacity in mRNA translation. Here we identify mutations of the Ribosomal Protein L38 (Rpl38) gene in mice exhibiting surprising tissue-specific patterning defects, including pronounced homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton. In Rpl38 mutant embryos, global protein synthesis is unchanged; however the translation of a select subset of Homeobox mRNAs is perturbed. Our data reveal that RPL38 facilitates 80S complex formation on these mRNAs as a regulatory component of the ribosome to confer transcript-specific translational control. We further show that Rpl38 expression is markedly enriched in regions of the embryo where loss-of-function phenotypes occur. Unexpectedly, a ribosomal protein (RP) expression screen reveals dynamic regulation of individual RPs within the vertebrate embryo. Collectively, these findings suggest that RP activity may be highly regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression and mammalian development.

abstract = {Although much is known about the regulation of gene transcription in eukaryotes, it is not clear whether cells have global controls that determine overall rates of transcription. We have investigated the effects that the DNA-to-protein ratio has on both total transcription and the transcription of individual genes in the unicellular eukaryote fission yeast. Mutants altered in cell size and those blocked in cell-cycle progression were used to vary the DNA-to-protein ratio over a 5-fold range. We found that cells of sizes within 2-fold of the wild-type value regulated global transcription to maintain similar transcription rates per protein regardless of the cellular DNA content. These changes in total transcription correlated with coordinated changes in gene occupancy by RNA polymerase II. In cell-cycle-arrested mutants exceeding a certain size, total transcription rates plateaued as DNA became limiting for transcription at low DNA-to-protein ratios [1]. Unexpectedly, expression levels of individual genes remained tightly coordinated with each other over the entire range of cell sizes. We propose that there is a coordinated, global control that determines the rate of transcription of most genes and that this control plays a role in regulating growth rate of the cell. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Cells are intrinsically noisy biochemical reactors: low reactant numbers can lead to significant statistical fluctuations in molecule numbers and reaction rates. Here we use an analytic model to investigate the emergent noise properties of genetic systems. We find for a single gene that noise is essentially determined at the translational level, and that the mean and variance of protein concentration can be independently controlled. The noise strength immediately following single gene induction is almost twice the final steady-state value. We find that fluctuations in the concentrations of a regulatory protein can propagate through a genetic cascade; translational noise control could explain the inefficient translation rates observed for genes encoding such regulatory proteins. For an autoregulatory protein, we demonstrate that negative feedback efficiently decreases system noise. The model can be used to predict the noise characteristics of networks of arbitrary connectivity. The general procedure is further illustrated for an autocatalytic protein and a bistable genetic switch. The analysis of intrinsic noise reveals biological roles of gene network structures and can lead to a deeper understanding of their evolutionary origin.},

Our analyses based on multiple expression profiles in 41 primary human tissues show that a gene's EV is significantly correlated with a number of features pertaining to the genomic, epigenomic, regulatory, polymorphic, functional, structural and network characteristics of the gene. We found that (i) EV of a gene is encoded, in part, by its genomic context and is further influenced by the epigenome; (ii) strong promoters induce less variable expression; (iii) less variable gene loci evolve under purifying selection against copy number polymorphisms; (iv) genes that encode inherently disordered or highly interacting proteins exhibit lower variability; and (v) genes with less variable expression are enriched for house-keeping functions, while genes with highly variable expression tend to function in development and extra-cellular response and are associated with human diseases. Thus, our analysis reveals a number of potential mediators as well as functional and evolutionary correlates of EV, and provides new insights into the inherent variability in eukaryotic gene expression.},

abstract = {Histones package DNA and regulate epigenetic states. For the latter, probably the most important histone is H3. Mammals have three near-identical H3 isoforms: canonical H3.1 and H3.2, and the replication-independent variant H3.3. This variant can accumulate in slowly dividing somatic cells, replacing canonical H3. Some replication-independent histones, through their ability to incorporate outside S-phase, are functionally important in the very slowly dividing mammalian germ line. Much remains to be learned of H3.3 functions in germ cell development. Histone H3.3 presents a unique genetic paradigm in that two conventional intron-containing genes encode the identical protein. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the developmental effects of null mutations in each of these genes. H3f3a mutants were viable to adulthood. Females were fertile, while males were subfertile with dysmorphic spermatozoa. H3f3b mutants were growth-deficient, dying at birth. H3f3b heterozygotes were also growth-deficient, with males being sterile because of arrest of round spermatids. This sterility was not accompanied by abnormalities in sex chromosome inactivation in meiosis I. Conditional ablation of H3f3b at the beginning of folliculogenesis resulted in zygote cleavage failure, establishing H3f3b as a maternal-effect gene, and revealing a requirement for H3.3 in the first mitosis. Simultaneous ablation of H3f3a and H3f3b in folliculogenesis resulted in early primary oocyte death, demonstrating a crucial role for H3.3 in oogenesis. These findings reveal a heavy reliance on H3.3 for growth, gametogenesis, and fertilization, identifying developmental processes that are particularly susceptible to H3.3 deficiency. They also reveal partial redundancy in function of H3f3a and H3f3b, with the latter gene being generally the most important.},

abstract = {The cell cycle is regulated by sequential activation, inactivation of cyclin dependent kinases (Cdk-s). Like all other Cdk-s, the catalytic subunit of Cdk5 is present in cycling cells. However, its highest concentration is found in differentiated neurons, and the only known protein that activates Cdk5 (i.e., p35) is expressed solely in the brain. Active Cdk5 is thought to be involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of the neurofilament proteins and tau which are hyperphosphorylated in neurodegenerative diseases. Recent reports suggest that Cdk5 may also contribute to cellular differentiation. Therefore, it would not be unusual to surmise that there exist specific proteins that regulate Cdk5 activity in cycling cells. In order to find if this was true, a cDNA library prepared from HeLa cells was screened using the yeast-two-hybrid system. The 60S ribosomal protein, L34, was identified as a Cdk5-interacting protein. Biochemical analyses reveal that L34 cannot activate Cdk5 but potently inhibits the p35-activated kinase. L34 also interacts with Cdk4 and, in parallel, inhibits the Cdk4/cyclin D1 activity. Interestingly, L34 does not interact with Cdk2 in the two-hybrid assay nor does it inhibit the Cdk2/cyclin A enzyme. The fact that a ribosomal protein inhibits Cdk5 and Cdk4 may suggest that these two kinases have a cellular role in translational regulation.},

abstract = {Noise-induced heterogeneity in gene expression is an inherent reality for cells. However, it is not well understood how noise strength changes for a single gene while the host cell is aging. Using a state-of-the-art microfluidic platform, we measure noise dynamics in aging yeast cells by tracking the generation-specific activity of the canonical GAL1 promoter. We observe noise reduction during normal aging of a cell, followed by a short catastrophe phase in which noise increased. We hypothesize that aging-associated increases in chromatin state transitions are behind the observed noise reduction and a stochastic model provides quantitative support to the proposed mechanism. Noise trends measured from strains with altered GAL1 promoter dynamics (constitutively active, synthetic with nucleosome-disfavoring sequences, and in the absence of RPD3, a global remodeling regulator) lend further support to our hypothesis. Observing similar noise dynamics from a different promoter (HHF2) provides support to the generality of our findings.},

abstract = {Both intrinsic cell state changes and variations in the composition of stem cell populations have been implicated as contributors to aging. We used single cell RNA-seq to dissect variability in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations from young and old mice from two strains. We found that cell cycle dominates the variability within each population, and that there is a lower frequency of cells in the G1 phase among old compared to young long-term hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that they traverse through G1 faster. Moreover, transcriptional changes in HSCs during aging are inversely related to those upon HSC differentiation, such that old short term (ST)-HSCs resemble young long-term (LT-HSCs), suggesting that they exist in a less differentiated state. Our results indicate both compositional changes and intrinsic, population-wide changes with age and are consistent with a model where a relationship between cell-cycle progression and self-renewal versus differentiation of HSCs is affected by aging and may contribute to the functional decline of old HSCs.},

abstract = {A central question in biology is whether variability between genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

Seven mammalian Sir2 homologs have been identified (SIRT1-SIRT7), and it has been speculated that some may have similar functions to Sir2. Here, we demonstrate that SIRT6 is a nuclear, chromatin-associated protein that promotes resistance to DNA damage and suppresses genomic instability in mouse cells, in association with a role in base excision repair (BER). SIRT6-deficient mice are small and at 2-3 weeks of age develop abnormalities that include profound lymphopenia, loss of subcutaneous fat, lordokyphosis, and severe metabolic defects, eventually dying at about 4 weeks. We conclude that one function of SIRT6 is to promote normal DNA repair, and that SIRT6 loss leads to abnormalities in mice that overlap with aging-associated degenerative processes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

While much is known about the molecular basis of pluripotency, the mechanisms of differentiation remain unclear. Here, we profile individual mouse embryonic stem cells as they progress along the neuronal lineage. We observe that cells pass from the pluripotent state to the neuronal state via an intermediate epiblast-like state. However, analysis of the rate at which cells enter and exit these observed cell states using a hidden Markov model indicates the presence of a chain of unobserved molecular states that each cell transits through stochastically in sequence. This chain of hidden states allows individual cells to record their position on the differentiation trajectory, thereby encoding a simple form of cellular memory. We suggest a statistical mechanics interpretation of these results that distinguishes between functionally distinct cellular “macrostates” and functionally similar molecular “microstates” and propose a model of stem cell differentiation as a non-Markov stochastic process.

abstract = {Most deep reinforcement learning algorithms are data inefficient in complex and rich environments, limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared neural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer across related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed, because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the different reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint training of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (Distill {\&} transfer learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we propose to share a "distilled" policy that captures common behaviour across tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay close to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several related methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust and more stable---attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {Forebrain cholinergic neurons modulate complex mammalian behaviors such as reward-related learning and cognitive functions. Although their dysfunction is implicated in various psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, the factors governing cholinergic neuron differentiation and diversity are mostly unknown. We tested the role of the LIM-homeobox gene Isl1 in the development of forebrain cholinergic neurons by conditionally deleting Isl1 using a Six3-cre transgene. A depletion of cholinergic interneurons in the dorsal and ventral striatum, and cholinergic projection neurons in the nucleus basalis is observed and is ascribed to an early and persistent defect in cholinergic neuron differentiation. Notably, cholinergic innervation to the neocortex is abolished, whereas that to the hippocampus is unaltered. The unique pattern of cholinergic hypoinnervation encountered is supported by the presence of cholinergic projection neurons in the medial septum, the magnocellular preoptic area, and the substantia innominata. Together, these results demonstrate the requirement for Isl1 in the development of restricted telencephalic cholinergic neurons and link the development of cholinergic neurons in anatomically disparate sites to Isl1 function.},

abstract = {When cells are exposed to death ligands such as TRAIL, a fraction undergoes apoptosis and a fraction survives; if surviving cells are re-exposed to TRAIL, fractional killing is once again observed. Therapeutic antibodies directed against TRAIL receptors also cause fractional killing, even at saturating concentrations, limiting their effectiveness. Fractional killing arises from cell-to-cell fluctuations in protein levels (extrinsic noise), but how this results in a clean bifurcation between life and death remains unclear. In this paper, we identify a threshold in the rate and timing of initiator caspase activation that distinguishes cells that live from those that die; by mapping this threshold, we can predict fractional killing of cells exposed to natural and synthetic agonists alone or in combination with sensitizing drugs such as bortezomib. A phenomenological model of the threshold also quantifies the contributions of two resistance genes (c-FLIP and Bcl-2), providing new insight into the control of cell fate by opposing pro-death and pro-survival proteins and suggesting new criteria for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic TRAIL receptor agonists.},

Better understanding their biological character is critical to understand the heart development and to apply CPs for the clinical arena. However, our knowledge remains incomplete. With the use of single-cell expression profiling, we have now revealed rapid and dynamic changes in gene expression profiles of the embryonic CPs during the early phase after their segregation from the cardiac mesoderm. Progressively, the nascent mesodermal gene Mesp1 terminated, and Nkx2-5+/Tbx5+ population rapidly replaced the Tbx5low+ population as the expression of the cardiac genes Tbx5 and Nkx2-5 increased. At the Early Headfold stage, Tbx5-expressing CPs gradually showed a unique molecular signature with signs of cardiomyocyte differentiation. Lineage-tracing revealed a developmentally distinct characteristic of this population. They underwent progressive differentiation only towards the cardiomyocyte lineage corresponding to the first heart field rather than being maintained as a progenitor pool. More importantly, Tbx5 likely plays an important role in a transcriptional network to regulate the distinct character of the FHF via a positive feedback loop to activate the robust expression of Tbx5 in CPs. These data expands our knowledge on the behavior of CPs during the early phase of cardiac development, subsequently providing a platform for further study.},

abstract = {Valvular Interstitial Cells (VICs) are a common substrate for congenital and adult heart disease yet the signaling mechanisms governing their formation during early valvulogenesis are incompletely understood. We developed an unbiased strategy to identify genes important in endocardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) using a spatial transcriptional profile. Endocardial cells overlaying the cushions of the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and outflow tract (OFT) undergo an EMT to yield VICs. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of gene expression between AVC, OFT, and ventricles (VEN) isolated from chick and mouse embryos at comparable stages of development (chick HH18; mouse E11.0) was performed. EMT occurs in the AVC and OFT cushions, but not VEN at this time. 198 genes in the chick (n=1) and 105 genes in the mouse (n=2) were enriched 2-fold in the cushions. Gene regulatory networks (GRN) generated from cushion-enriched gene lists confirmed TGF$\beta$ as a nodal point and identified NF-$\kappa$B as a potential node. To reveal previously unrecognized regulators of EMT four candidate genes, Hapln1, Id1, Foxp2, and Meis2, and a candidate pathway, NF-$\kappa$B, were selected. In vivo spatial expression of each gene was confirmed by in situ hybridization and a functional role for each in endocardial EMT was determined by siRNA knockdown in a collagen gel assay. Our spatial-transcriptional profiling strategy yielded gene lists which reflected the known biology of the system. Further analysis accurately identified and validated previously unrecognized novel candidate genes and the NF-$\kappa$B pathway as regulators of endocardial cell EMT in vitro.},

abstract = {The biochemical processes leading to the synthesis of new proteins are random, as they typically involve a small number of diffusing molecules. They lead to fluctuations in the number of proteins in a single cell as a function of time and to cell-to-cell variability of protein abundances. These in turn can lead to phenotypic heterogeneity in a population of genetically identical cells. Phenotypic heterogeneity may have important consequences for the development of multicellular organisms and the fitness of bacterial colonies, raising the question of how it is regulated. Here we review the experimental evidence that transcriptional regulation affects noise in gene expression, and discuss how the noise strength is encoded in the architecture of the promoter region. We discuss how models based on specific molecular mechanisms of gene regulation can make experimentally testable predictions for how changes to the promoter architecture are reflected in gene expression noise. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Biophysics Volume 42 is May 06, 2013. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

@article{Lehner2008,
abstract = {Gene expression, like many biological processes, is subject to noise. This noise has been measured on a global scale, but its general importance to the fitness of an organism is unclear. Here, I show that noise in gene expression in yeast has evolved to prevent harmful stochastic variation in the levels of genes that reduce fitness when their expression levels change. Therefore, there has probably been widespread selection to minimise noise in gene expression. Selection to minimise noise, because it results in gene expression that is stable to stochastic variation in cellular components, may also constrain the ability of gene expression to respond to non-stochastic variation. I present evidence that this has indeed been the case in yeast. I therefore conclude that gene expression noise is an important biological trait, and one that probably limits the evolvability of complex living systems.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the lineage relationships and dynamic event histories of individual cells within their native spatial context is a long-standing challenge in biology. Many biological processes of interest occur in optically opaque or physically inaccessible contexts, necessitating approaches other than direct imaging. Here we describe a synthetic system that enables cells to record lineage information and event histories in the genome in a format that can be subsequently read out of single cells in situ. This system, termed memory by engineered mutagenesis with optical in situ readout (MEMOIR), is based on a set of barcoded recording elements termed scratchpads. The state of a given scratchpad can be irreversibly altered by CRISPR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis, and later read out in single cells through multiplexed single-molecule RNA fluorescence hybridization (smFISH). Using MEMOIR as a proof of principle, we engineered mouse embryonic stem cells to contain multiple scratchpads and other recording components. In these cells, scratchpads were altered in a progressive and stochastic fashion as the cells proliferated. Analysis of the final states of scratchpads in single cells in situ enabled reconstruction of lineage information from cell colonies. Combining analysis of endogenous gene expression with lineage reconstruction in the same cells further allowed inference of the dynamic rates at which embryonic stem cells switch between two gene expression states. Finally, using simulations, we show how parallel MEMOIR systems operating in the same cell could enable recording and readout of dynamic cellular event histories. MEMOIR thus provides a versatile platform for information recording and in situ, single-cell readout across diverse biological systems.},

Frameworks exist for understanding how stochastic fluctuations and transient differences in cell state contribute to experimentally observable variations in cellular responses. However, current methods do not allow identification of the sources of variability between and within stable subpopulations of cells. We present a data-driven modeling framework for the analysis of populations comprising heterogeneous subpopulations. Our approach combines mixture modeling with frameworks for distribution approximation, facilitating the integration of multiple single-cell datasets and the detection of causal differences between and within subpopulations. The computational efficiency of our framework allows hundreds of competing hypotheses to be compared. We initially validate our method using simulated data with an understood ground truth, then we analyze data collected using quantitative single-cell microscopy of cultured sensory neurons involved in pain initiation. This approach allows us to quantify the relative contribution of neuronal subpopulations, culture conditions, and expression levels of signaling proteins to the observed cell-to-cell variability in NGF/TrkA-initiated Erk1/2 signaling.},

@article{Marlow2014a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Planktonic ciliated larvae are characteristic for the life cycle of marine invertebrates. Their most prominent feature is the apical organ harboring sensory cells and neurons of largely undetermined function. An elucidation of the relationships between various forms of primary larvae and apical organs is key to understanding the evolution of animal life cycles. These relationships have remained enigmatic due to the scarcity of comparative molecular data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To compare apical organs and larval body patterning, we have studied regionalization of the episphere, the upper hemisphere of the trochophore larva of the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii. We examined the spatial distribution of transcription factors and of Wnt signaling components previously implicated in anterior neural development. Pharmacological activation of Wnt signaling with Gsk3$\beta$ antagonists abolishes expression of apical markers, consistent with a repressive role of Wnt signaling in the specification of apical tissue. We refer to this Wnt-sensitive, six3- and foxq2-expressing part of the episphere as the 'apical plate'. We also unraveled a molecular signature of the apical organ--devoid of six3 but expressing foxj, irx, nkx3 and hox--that is shared with other marine phyla including cnidarians. Finally, we characterized the cell types that form part of the apical organ by profiling by image registration, which allows parallel expression profiling of multiple cells. Besides the hox-expressing apical tuft cells, this revealed the presence of putative light- and mechanosensory as well as multiple peptidergic cell types that we compared to apical organ cell types of other animal phyla.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The similar formation of a six3+, foxq2+ apical plate, sensitive to Wnt activity and with an apical tuft in its six3-free center, is most parsimoniously explained by evolutionary conservation. We propose that a simple apical organ--comprising an apical tuft and a basal plexus innervated by sensory-neurosecretory apical plate cells--was present in the last common ancestors of cnidarians and bilaterians. One of its ancient functions would have been the control of metamorphosis. Various types of apical plate cells would then have subsequently been added to the apical organ in the divergent bilaterian lineages. Our findings support an ancient and common origin of primary ciliated larvae.},

abstract = {The meiosis-specific chromosomal events of homolog pairing, synapsis, and recombination occur over an extended meiotic prophase I that is many times longer than prophase of mitosis. Here we show that, in mice, maintenance of an extended meiotic prophase I requires the gene Meioc, a germ-cell specific factor conserved in most metazoans. In mice, Meioc is expressed in male and female germ cells upon initiation of and throughout meiotic prophase I. Mouse germ cells lacking Meioc initiate meiosis: they undergo pre-meiotic DNA replication, they express proteins involved in synapsis and recombination, and a subset of cells progress as far as the zygotene stage of prophase I. However, cells in early meiotic prophase-as early as the preleptotene stage-proceed to condense their chromosomes and assemble a spindle, as if having progressed to metaphase. Meioc-deficient spermatocytes that have initiated synapsis mis-express CYCLIN A2, which is normally expressed in mitotic spermatogonia, suggesting a failure to properly transition to a meiotic cell cycle program. MEIOC interacts with YTHDC2, and the two proteins pull-down an overlapping set of mitosis-associated transcripts. We conclude that when the meiotic chromosomal program is initiated, Meioc is simultaneously induced so as to extend meiotic prophase. Specifically, MEIOC, together with YTHDC2, promotes a meiotic (as opposed to mitotic) cell cycle program via post-transcriptional control of their target transcripts.},

To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell.

We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression.},

abstract = {A method utilizing sequential enzymatic incubation in collagenase (1 mg/ml) and trypsin (2.5 mg/ml) has been developed for the dissociation of the seminiferous epithelium. A significant advantage of this method is that, following collagenase incubation and washings in an enriched Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer solution, isolated seminiferous tubules are obtained which are free of interstitial cells. The "purified" seminiferous epithelium is then dissociated with trypsin. A further advantage of this dissociation technique has been a reduction in the number of symplasts (multinucleate cells) which form by the opening up of the intercellular bridges that occur between synchronously differentiating clusters of germ cells. Both the elimination of the interstitial cells and the reduction in the number of symplasts have made possible the recovery of more highly enriched germ cell fractions. The homogeneity of the cell fractions was determined by light and electron microscopy. Integrity of the isolated cells was verified by Trypan blue exclusion and measurement of oxygen consumption. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

Their diversity and key phylogenetic position are enhanced, from a research viewpoint, by anatomically simple and transparent embryos, compact rapidly evolving genomes, and the availability of powerful experimental and computational tools with which to study these organisms. Tunicates are thus a powerful system for exploring chordate evolution and how extreme variation in genome sequence and gene regulatory network architecture is compatible with the preservation of an ancestral chordate body plan.},

abstract = {Network analysis is a powerful way of modeling chromatin interactions. Assortativity is a network property used in social sciences to identify factors affecting how people establish social ties. We propose a new approach, using chromatin assortativity to integrate the epigenomic landscape of a specific cell type with its chromatin interaction network and thus investigate which proteins or chromatin marks mediate genomic contacts. We use high-resolution Promoter Capture Hi-C and Hi-Cap data as well as ChIA-PET data from mouse embryonic stem cells to investigate promoter-centered chromatin interaction networks and calculate the presence of specific epigenomic features in the chromatin fragments constituting the nodes of the network. We estimate the association of these features to the topology of four chromatin interaction networks and identify features localized in connected areas of the network. Polycomb Group proteins and associated histone marks are the features with the highest chromatin assortativity in promoter-centred networks. We then ask which features distinguish contacts amongst promoters from contacts between promoters and other genomic elements. We observe higher chromatin assortativity of the actively elongating form of RNA Polymerase 2 (RNAPII) compared to inactive forms only in interactions between promoters and other elements. Contacts among promoters, and between promoters and other elements have different characteristic epigenomic features. We identify a possible role for the elongating form of RNAPII in mediating interactions among promoters, enhancers and transcribed gene bodies. Our approach facilitates the study of multiple genome-wide epigenomic profiles, considering network topology and allowing the comparison of chromatin interaction networks.},

We show that, as in yeast, recombination in the mouse is initiated by Spo11-dependent DSBs that form during leptotene.

abstract = {CD4 molecules serve as coreceptors for the T-cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex that are engaged coordinately with TCR and facilitate antigen-specific T-cell activation leading to interleukin 2 (IL-2) production and proliferation. However, cross-ligation of CD4 molecules prior to TCR stimulation has been shown to prime CD4 T cells to undergo apoptosis. Although in vivo and in vitro experiments have implicated the involvement of Fas/FasL interaction in this CD4 cross-linking (CD4XL)-induced apoptosis, detailed mechanisms to account for cell death induction have not been elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that CD4XL in purified T cells not only led to Fas up-regulation but also primed CD4 T cells to express FasL upon CD3 stimulation and rendered the T cells susceptible to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Notably, in addition to CD4(+) T cells, CD4XL-induced sensitization for apoptosis was observed in CD8(+) T cells as well and was associated with Bcl-x down-modulation. Both CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets underwent apoptosis following cell-cell contact with FasL(+) CD4 T cells. CD28 costimulation abrogated CD4XL/CD3-induced apoptosis with restoration of IL-2 production and prevented Bcl-x down-modulation. As CD4 molecules are the primary receptors for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), we conclude that HIV-1 envelope mediated CD4XL can lead to the generation of FasL-expressing CD4(+) T cells that can lead to apoptosis of CD4 as well as CD8 T cells. These findings implicate a novel mechanism for CD8 T-cell depletion in HIV disease.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Next-generation sequencing captures sequence differences in reads relative to a reference genome or transcriptome, including splicing events and complex variants involving multiple mismatches and long indels. We present computational methods for fast detection of complex variants and splicing in short reads, based on a successively constrained search process of merging and filtering position lists from a genomic index. Our methods are implemented in GSNAP (Genomic Short-read Nucleotide Alignment Program), which can align both single- and paired-end reads as short as 14 nt and of arbitrarily long length. It can detect short- and long-distance splicing, including interchromosomal splicing, in individual reads, using probabilistic models or a database of known splice sites. Our program also permits SNP-tolerant alignment to a reference space of all possible combinations of major and minor alleles, and can align reads from bisulfite-treated DNA for the study of methylation state. RESULTS In comparison testing, GSNAP has speeds comparable to existing programs, especially in reads of {\textgreater} or=70 nt and is fastest in detecting complex variants with four or more mismatches or insertions of 1-9 nt and deletions of 1-30 nt. Although SNP tolerance does not increase alignment yield substantially, it affects alignment results in 7-8{\%} of transcriptional reads, typically by revealing alternate genomic mappings for a read. Simulations of bisulfite-converted DNA show a decrease in identifying genomic positions uniquely in 6{\%} of 36 nt reads and 3{\%} of 70 nt reads.

abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

In our approach, termed Patch-seq, a patch-clamp stimulus protocol is followed by the aspiration of the entire somatic compartment into the recording pipette, reverse transcription of RNA including addition of unique molecular identifiers, cDNA amplification, Illumina library preparation and sequencing. We show that Patch-seq reveals a close link between electrophysiological characteristics, responses to acute chemical challenges and RNA expression of neurotransmitter receptors and channels. Moreover, it distinguishes neuronal subpopulations that correspond to both well-established and, to our knowledge, hitherto undescribed neuronal subtypes. Our findings demonstrate the ability of Patch-seq to precisely map neuronal subtypes and predict their network contributions in the brain.},

abstract = {Meiotic prophase I (MPI), is an initial stage of meiosis characterized by intricate homologous chromosome interactions, synapsis, and DNA recombination. These processes depend on the complex, but poorly understood early MPI events of homologous chromosome search, alignment, and pairing. Detailed molecular investigation of these early events requires isolation of individual MPI substages. Enrichment for Pachytene (P) and Diplotene (D) substages of late MPI was previously accomplished using flow cytometry. However, separation of early MPI spermatocytes, specifically, of Leptotene (L) and Zygotene (Z) substages, has been a challenge due to these cells' similar characteristics. In this report, we describe an optimized Hoechst-33342 (Hoechst)-based flow cytometry approach for isolating individual MPI populations from adult mouse testis. We get significant enrichment for individual L and Z spermatocytes, previously inseparable from each other, and optimize the isolation of other MPI substages. Our flow cytometry approach is a combination of three optimized strategies. The first is optimization of testis dissociation protocol that yields more consistent and reproducible testicular single cell suspension. The second involves optimization of flow cytometric gating protocol where a critical addition to the standard protocol for cell discrimination based on Hoechst fluorescence, involves a back-gating technique based on light scattering parameters. This step specifies selection of individual MPI substages. The third, is an addition of DNA content restriction to the gating protocol to minimize contamination from non-meiotic cells. Finally, we confirm significant enrichment of high-purity Preleptotene (PreL), L, Z, P, and D MPI spermatocytes using stage-specific marker distribution. The technique will facilitate understanding of the molecular events underlying MPI. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.},

Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, we examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T cell activation. We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity. These findings reveal how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled manner.},

Understanding how the rhythmic signal arises, how it achieves precision and how it patterns the embryo remain challenging issues.

abstract = {Co-training (or more generally, co-regularization) has been a popular algorithm for semi-supervised learning in data with two feature representations (or views), but the fundamental assumptions underlying this type of models are still unclear. In this paper we propose a Bayesian undirected graphical model for co-training, or more generally for semi-supervised multi-view learning. This makes explicit the previously unstated assumptions of a large class of co-training type algorithms, and also clarifies the circumstances under which these assumptions fail. Building upon new insights from this model, we propose an improved method for co-training, which is a novel co-training kernel for Gaussian process classifiers. The resulting approach is convex and avoids local-maxima problems, and it can also automatically estimate how much each view should be trusted to accommodate noisy or unreliable views. The Bayesian co-training approach can also elegantly handle data samples with missing views, that is, some of the views are not available for some data points at learning time. This is further extended to an active sensing framework, in which the missing (sample, view) pairs are actively acquired to improve learning performance. The strength of active sensing model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view classification on all the samples. Experiments on toy data and several real world data sets illustrate the benefits of this approach.},

Surprisingly, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-Seq technology. We examined data from five published studies and found that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we found that the proportion of genes reported as expressed explains a substantial part of observed variability and that this quantity varies systematically across experimental batches. Furthermore, we found that the implemented experimental designs confounded outcomes of interest with batch effects, a design that can bring into question some of the conclusions of these studies. Finally, we propose a simple experimental design that can ameliorate the effect of theses systematic errors have on downstream results.},

It is not established whether Mesp1-induced mesoderm cells are intrinsically heterogeneous, or are simply capable of multiple lineage decisions. In the current study, we applied single-cell RNA-seq to analyze Mesp1+ mesoderm. Initial whole transcriptome analysis showed a surprising homogeneity among Mesp1-induced mesoderm cells.

Using these technological advances, we studied epigenomic cell-state dynamics in three in vitro models of cellular differentiation and pluripotency, where we observed characteristic patterns of epigenome remodeling and cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The described method enables single-cell analysis of DNA methylation in a broad range of biological systems, including embryonic development, stem cell differentiation, and cancer.

abstract = {Sex and recombination are pervasive throughout nature despite their substantial costs. Understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain these phenomena is a central challenge in biology. One longstanding hypothesis argues that sex is beneficial because recombination speeds adaptation. Theory has proposed several distinct population genetic mechanisms that could underlie this advantage. For example, sex can promote the fixation of beneficial mutations either by alleviating interference competition (the Fisher-Muller effect) or by separating them from deleterious load (the ruby in the rubbish effect). Previous experiments confirm that sex can increase the rate of adaptation, but these studies did not observe the evolutionary dynamics that drive this effect at the genomic level. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, comparison between the sequence-level dynamics of adaptation in experimental sexual and asexual Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which allows us to identify the specific mechanisms by which sex speeds adaptation. We find that sex alters the molecular signatures of evolution by changing the spectrum of mutations that fix, and confirm theoretical predictions that it does so by alleviating clonal interference. We also show that substantially deleterious mutations hitchhike to fixation in adapting asexual populations. In contrast, recombination prevents such mutations from fixing. Our results demonstrate that sex both speeds adaptation and alters its molecular signature by allowing natural selection to more efficiently sort beneficial from deleterious mutations.},

We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a zero-inflated negative binomial noise model, and nonlinear gene-gene or gene-dispersion interactions are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can therefore be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells frequently display substantial heterogeneity in gene expression, cellular morphology and physiology. It has been suggested that by rapidly generating a sub- population with novel phenotypic traits, phenotypic heterogeneity (or plasticity) accelerates the rate of adaptive evolution in populations facing extreme environmental challenges. This issue is important as cell-to-cell phenotypic heterogeneity may initiate key steps in microbial evolution of drug resistance and cancer progression. Here, we study how stochastic transi- tions between cellular states influence evolutionary adaptation to a stressful environment in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Wedeveloped inducible synthetic gene circuits that gen- erate varying degrees of expression stochasticity of an antifungal resistance gene. Weiniti- ated laboratory evolutionary experiments with genotypes carrying different versions of the genetic circuit by exposing the corresponding populations to gradually increasing antifungal stress. Phenotypic heterogeneity altered the evolutionary dynamics by transforming the adaptive landscape that relates genotype to fitness. Specifically, it enhanced the adaptive value of beneficial mutations through synergism between cell-to-cell variability and genetic variation. Our work demonstrates that phenotypic heterogeneity is an evolving trait when populations face a chronic selection pressure. It shapes evolutionary trajectories at the genomic level and facilitates evolutionary rescue from a deteriorating environmental stress.},

The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a "molecular contact memory" approach. In each nucleus, only ∼30{\%} of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning is not detectably inherited but instead is stochastically reshuffled. Contact of individual LADs with the NL is linked to transcriptional repression and H3K9 dimethylation in single cells. Furthermore, we identify the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a as a regulator of NL contacts. Collectively, these results highlight principles of the dynamic spatial architecture of chromosomes in relation to gene regulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

However, on a global scale, the effect of molecular variability for embryonic developmental stages is largely underexplored. Here, to understand the origins of transcriptome-wide variability of oocytes to blastocysts in human and mouse, we examined RNA-Seq datasets. Evaluating Pearson correlation, Shannon entropy and noise patterns ($\eta$(2) vs. $\mu$), our investigations reveal a phase transition from low to saturating levels of diversity and variability of transcriptome-wide expressions through the development stages. To probe the observed behaviour further, we utilised a stochastic transcriptional model to simulate the global gene expressions pattern for each development stage. From the model, we concur that transcriptome-wide regulation initially begins from 2-cell stage, and becomes strikingly variable from 8-cell stage due to amplification and quantal transcriptional activity.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cell populations exhibit considerable intercellular variation in the level of a given protein or mRNA. Both intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise drive this variability in gene expression. More specifically, extrinsic noise is the expression variability that arises from cell-to-cell differences in cell-specific factors such as enzyme levels, cell size and cell cycle stage. In contrast, intrinsic noise is the expression variability that is not accounted for by extrinsic noise, and typically arises from the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes. Two-color reporter experiments are employed to decompose expression variability into its intrinsic and extrinsic noise components. Analytical formulas for intrinsic and extrinsic noise are derived for a class of stochastic gene expression models, where variations in cell-specific factors cause fluctuations in model parameters, in particular, transcription and/or translation rate fluctuations. Assuming mRNA production occurs in random bursts, transcription rate is represented by either the burst frequency (how often the bursts occur) or the burst size (number of mRNAs produced in each burst). Our analysis shows that fluctuations in the transcription burst frequency enhance extrinsic noise but do not affect the intrinsic noise. On the contrary, fluctuations in the transcription burst size or mRNA translation rate dramatically increase both intrinsic and extrinsic noise components. Interestingly, simultaneous fluctuations in transcription and translation rates arising from randomness in ATP abundance can decrease intrinsic noise measured in a two-color reporter assay. Finally, we discuss how these formulas can be combined with single-cell gene expression data from two-color reporter experiments for estimating model parameters.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing has allowed for unprecedented detail in gene expression analyses, yet its efficient application to single cells is challenged by the small starting amounts of RNA. We have developed CEL-Seq, a method for overcoming this limitation by barcoding and pooling samples before linearly amplifying mRNA with the use of one round of in vitro transcription. We show that CEL-Seq gives more reproducible, linear, and sensitive results than a PCR-based amplification method. We demonstrate the power of this method by studying early C. elegans embryonic development at single-cell resolution. Differential distribution of transcripts between sister cells is seen as early as the two-cell stage embryo, and zygotic expression in the somatic cell lineages is enriched for transcription factors. The robust transcriptome quantifications enabled by CEL-Seq will be useful for transcriptomic analyses of complex tissues containing populations of diverse cell types},

abstract = {Cholinergic motor neurons are defined by the coexpression of a battery of genes encoding proteins that act sequentially to synthesize, package and degrade acetylcholine and reuptake its breakdown product, choline. How expression of these critical motor neuron identity determinants is controlled and coordinated is not understood. We show here that, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, all members of the cholinergic gene battery, as well as many other markers of terminal motor neuron fate, are co-regulated by a shared cis-regulatory signature and a common trans-acting factor, the phylogenetically conserved COE (Collier, Olf, EBF)-type transcription factor UNC-3. UNC-3 initiated and maintained expression of cholinergic fate markers and was sufficient to induce cholinergic fate in other neuron types. UNC-3 furthermore operated in negative feedforward loops to induce the expression of transcription factors that repress individual UNC-3-induced terminal fate markers, resulting in diversification of motor neuron differentiation programs in specific motor neuron subtypes. A chordate ortholog of UNC-3, Ciona intestinalis COE, was also both required and sufficient for inducing a cholinergic fate. Thus, UNC-3 is a terminal selector for cholinergic motor neuron differentiation whose function is conserved across phylogeny.},

abstract = {To achieve an integrated understanding of the stem cell system of planarians at both the cellular and molecular levels, we developed a new method by combining "fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) index sorting" analysis and single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the gene expression and cell cycle state of stem cells simultaneously. Single cells were collected using FACS, and cDNAs of each cell were used for semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The results were plotted on the FACS sorting profile using the "index sorting" function, which enabled us to analyze the gene expression in combination with cell biological data (such as cell cycle phase) for each cell. Here we investigated the adult stem cells of planarians using this method and obtained findings suggesting that the stem cells might undergo commitment during S to G2/M phase. This method could be a powerful and straightforward tool for examining the stem cell biology of not only planarians but also other organisms, including vertebrates.},

abstract = {YTHDF2 binds and destabilizes N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified mRNA. The extent to which this branch of m6A RNA-regulatory pathway functions in vivo and contributes to mammalian development remains unknown. Here we find that YTHDF2 deficiency is partially permissive in mice and results in female-specific infertility. Using conditional mutagenesis, we demonstrate that YTHDF2 is autonomously required within the germline to produce MII oocytes that are competent to sustain early zygotic development. Oocyte maturation is associated with a wave of maternal RNA degradation, and the resulting relative changes to the MII transcriptome are integral to oocyte quality. The loss of YTHDF2 results in the failure to regulate transcript dosage of a cohort of genes during oocyte maturation, with enrichment observed for the YTHDF2-binding consensus and evidence of m6A in these upregulated genes. In summary, the m6A-reader YTHDF2 is an intrinsic determinant of mammalian oocyte competence and early zygotic development. In this issue of Molecular cell, Ivanova et al. report an in vivo function of the RNA m6A reader YTHDF2 in the regulation of the maternal transcriptome during oocyte maturation and its importance for the establishment of competent oocytes that can sustain early embryo development.},

In particular, genome-wide single-cell measurements such as transcriptome sequencing enable the characterization of cellular composition as well as functional variation in homogenic cell populations. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to group cells that belong to the same cell types based on gene expression patterns. The corresponding computational problem is to cluster a noisy high dimensional dataset with substantially fewer objects (cells) than the number of variables (genes).$\backslash$nResults: In this paper we describe a novel algorithm named SNN-Cliq that clusters single-cell transcriptomes. SNN-Cliq utilizes the concept of shared nearest neighbor that shows advantages in handling high dimensional data. When evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real experimental datasets, SNN-Cliq outperformed the state-of-the-art methods tested.

In this study RBJ/Dn{\~{A}}— C57BL/6J F1 males, heterozygous for four Robertsonian translocations (2N=36), were analyzed to determine effects on germ cells of error during meiosis. Analysis of sperm by three color fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed significantly elevated aneuploidy, thus validating Robertsonian heterozygous mice as a model for production of chromosomally abnormal gametes. Primary spermatocytes from heterozygous males exhibited abnormalities of chromosome pairing in meiotic prophase and metaphase. In spite of prophase abnormalities, the prophase/metaphase transition occurred. However, an increased frequency of cells with misaligned condensed chromosomes was observed. Cytological analysis of both young and adult heterozygous mice revealed increased apoptosis in spermatocytes during meiotic metaphase I. Metaphase spermatocytes with misaligned chromosomes accounted for a significant proportion of the apoptotic spermatocytes, suggesting that a checkpoint process identifies aberrant meioses. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that kinetochores of chromosomes that failed to align on the spindle stained more intensely for kinetochore antigens CENP-E and CENP-F than did aligned chromosomes. Taken together, these observations are consistent with detection of malattached chromosomes by a meiotic spindle checkpoint mechanism that monitors attachment and/or congression of homologous chromosome pairs. However, the relatively high frequency of gametic aneuploidy suggests that the checkpoint mechanism does not efficiently eliminate all germ cells with chromosomal abnormalities.},

Genes containing a TATA box in their promoters show an increased interspecies variability in expression, independent of their functional association. Examining additional data sets, we find that this enhanced expression divergence of TATA-containing genes is consistent across all eukaryotes studied to date, including nematodes, fruit flies, plants and mammals. TATA-dependent regulation may enhance the sensitivity of gene expression to genetic perturbations, thus facilitating expression divergence at particular genetic loci.},

We show that large-scale CNVs cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a population of cells.},

abstract = {The evolution of the highest-order human brain center, the " pallium" or " cortex," remains enigmatic. To elucidate its origins, we set out to identify related brain parts in phylogenetically distant animals, to then unravel common aspects in cellular composition and molecular architecture. Here, we compare vertebrate pallium development to that of the mushroom bodies, sensory-associative brain centers, in an annelid. Using a newly developed protocol for cellular profiling by image registration (PrImR), we obtain a high-resolution gene expression map for the developing annelid brain. Comparison to the vertebrate pallium reveals that the annelid mushroom bodies develop from similar molecular coordinates within a conserved overall molecular brain topology and that their development involves conserved patterning mechanisms and produces conserved neuron types that existed already in the protostome-deuterostome ancestors. These data indicate deep homology of pallium and mushroom bodies and date back the origin of higher brain centers to prebilaterian times. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells exhibit large variability (noise) in gene expression, with important consequences for cellular function. Although the amount of noise decreases with and is thus partly determined by the mean expression level, the extent to which different promoter sequences can deviate away from this trend is not fully known. Here, we present a high-throughput method for measuring promoter driven noise for thousands of designed synthetic promoters in parallel. We use it to investigate how promoters encode different noise levels and find that the noise levels of promoters with similar mean expression levels can vary more than one order of magnitude, with nucleosome-disfavoring sequences resulting in lower noise and more transcription factor binding sites resulting in higher noise. We propose a kinetic model of gene expression that takes into account the non-specific DNA binding and one-dimensional sliding along the DNA, which occurs when transcription factors search for their target sites. We show that this assumption can improve the prediction of the mean-independent component of expression noise for our designed promoter sequences, suggesting that transcription factor target search may affect gene expression noise. Consistent with our findings in designed promoters, we find that binding site multiplicity in native promoters is associated with higher expression noise. Overall, our results demonstrate that small changes in promoter DNA sequence can tune noise levels in a manner that is predictable and partly decoupled from effects on the mean expression levels. These insights may assist in designing promoters with desired noise levels.},

abstract = {While gene expression noise has been shown to drive dramatic phenotypic variations, the molecular basis for this variability in mammalian systems is not well understood. Gene expression has been shown to be regulated by promoter architecture and the associated chromatin environment. However, the exact contribution of these two factors in regulating expression noise has not been explored. Using a dual-reporter lentiviral model system, we deconvolved the influence of the promoter sequence to systematically study the contribution of the chromatin environment at different genomic locations in regulating expression noise. By integrating a large-scale analysis to quantify mRNA levels by smFISH and protein levels by flow cytometry in single cells, we found that mean expression and noise are uncorrelated across genomic locations. Furthermore, we showed that this independence could be explained by the orthogonal control of mean expression by the transcript burst size and noise by the burst frequency. Finally, we showed that genomic locations displaying higher expression noise are associated with more repressed chromatin, thereby indicating the contribution of the chromatin environment in regulating expression noise. {\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors.

abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {During spermiogenesis, round spermatids undergo complex morphological, biochemical, and physiological modifications resulting in the formation of mature spermatozoa. While in round spermatids histones and non-histone proteins are replaced by transition proteins, in elongating spermatids, transition proteins are removed from the condensing chromatin and are replaced by protamines, which are the principal basic nuclear proteins of mature spermatozoa. The tightly packed DNA-protamine complexes cease transcription several days before the completion of spermiogenesis. Thus, major modifications in both nuclear and cytoplasmic structures continue throughout spermiogenesis, stringent temporal and stage-specific gene expression is a prerequisite for the correct differentiation of round spermatids into mature spermatozoa. The genes for transition proteins and protamines are transcribed in round and elongating spermatids. Transcription is regulated via methylation and trans-acting factors that bind to the TATA-box, the CRE-box, or other specific DNA sequences in the promoter region. The transcripts are stored as ribonucleoprotein particles in a translationally repressed state for several days and are translated in elongating and elongated spermatids. It has been demonstrated that, in haploid spermatids, essentially every mRNA exhibits evidence of translational repression. Translational regulation involves protein repressors that bind to the poly-A tail or specific RNA sequences located in the 3'-UTR.},

abstract = {Because nucleosomes are widely replaced by protamine in mature human sperm, the epigenetic contributions of sperm chromatin to embryo development have been considered highly limited. Here we show that the retained nucleosomes are significantly enriched at loci of developmental importance, including imprinted gene clusters, microRNA clusters, HOX gene clusters, and the promoters of stand-alone developmental transcription and signalling factors. Notably, histone modifications localize to particular developmental loci. Dimethylated lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me2) is enriched at certain developmental promoters, whereas large blocks of H3K4me3 localize to a subset of developmental promoters, regions in HOX clusters, certain noncoding RNAs, and generally to paternally expressed imprinted loci, but not paternally repressed loci. Notably, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) is significantly enriched at developmental promoters that are repressed in early embryos, including many bivalent (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) promoters in embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, developmental promoters are generally DNA hypomethylated in sperm, but acquire methylation during differentiation. Taken together, epigenetic marking in sperm is extensive, and correlated with developmental regulators.},

We show that promoter interactions are highly cell type specific and enriched for links between active promoters and epigenetically marked enhancers. Promoter interactomes reflect lineage relationships of the hematopoietic tree, consistent with dynamic remodeling of nuclear architecture during differentiation. Interacting regions are enriched in genetic variants linked with altered expression of genes they contact, highlighting their functional role. We exploit this rich resource to connect non-coding disease variants to putative target promoters, prioritizing thousands of disease-candidate genes and implicating disease pathways.

Aging affected naive T cell maintenance fundamentally differently in mice and men. Whereas the naive T cell pool in mice was almost exclusively sustained by thymus output throughout their lifetime, the maintenance of the adult human naive T cell pool occurred almost exclusively through peripheral T cell division.

abstract = {The histone variant H3.3 is involved in diverse biological processes, including development, transcriptional memory and transcriptional reprogramming, as well as diseases, including most notably malignant brain tumors. Recently, we developed a knockout mouse model for the H3f3b gene, one of two genes encoding H3.3. Here, we show that targeted disruption of H3f3b results in a number of phenotypic abnormalities, including a reduction in H3.3 histone levels, leading to male infertility, as well as abnormal sperm and testes morphology. Additionally, null germ cell populations at specific stages in spermatogenesis, in particular spermatocytes and spermatogonia, exhibited increased rates of apoptosis. Disruption of H3f3b also altered histone post-translational modifications and gene expression in the testes, with the most prominent changes occurring at genes involved in spermatogenesis. Finally, H3f3b null testes also exhibited abnormal germ cell chromatin reorganization and reduced protamine incorporation. Taken together, our studies indicate a major role for H3.3 in spermatogenesis through regulation of chromatin dynamics.},

abstract = {The apoptosis-inducing Fas ligand (FasL) is a type II transmembrane protein that is involved in the downregulation of immune reactions by activation-induced cell death (AICD) as well as in T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Proteolytic cleavage leads to the generation of membrane-bound N-terminal fragments and a soluble FasL (sFasL) ectodomain. sFasL can be detected in the serum of patients with dysregulated inflammatory diseases and is discussed to affect Fas-FasL-mediated apoptosis. Using pharmacological approaches in 293T cells, in vitro cleavage assays as well as loss and gain of function studies in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we demonstrate that the disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM10 is critically involved in the shedding of FasL. In primary human T cells, FasL shedding is significantly reduced after inhibition of ADAM10. The resulting elevated FasL surface expression is associated with increased killing capacity and an increase of T cells undergoing AICD. Overall, our findings suggest that ADAM10 represents an important molecular modulator of FasL-mediated cell death.},

abstract = {We characterized the genetic variability of gene expression in terms of trans and cis variability for each yeast transcript. Genes that are highly regulated by nucleosomes showed a high degree of trans variability. From the expression profiles of mutants for various chromatin modifiers, we found that trans-variable genes are distinctly regulated at the chromatin level. The effect of chromatin regulators was highly significant, even when compared with that of transcription factors. The DNA-binding activities of transcription factors had a low influence on trans variability. In the case of the basal transcription factor TBP and TBP-associated factor TAF1, expression variability was coupled with the histone acetyltransferase activities of TAF1 and other factors, rather than with the binding of TBP to DNA. Additionally, we found that the correlation of TATA-box presence and expression variability could be explained in terms of chromatin regulation. The lack of activating histone modifications may subject TATA-containing promoters to chromatin regulation processes. Our results propose that epigenetic regulation has a central role in the variation and evolution of gene expression.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variability (noise) is an important feature of gene expression that impacts cell fitness and development. The regulatory mechanism of this variability is not fully understood. Here we investigate the effect on gene expression noise in divergent gene pairs (DGPs). We generated reporters driven by divergent promoters, rearranged their gene order, and probed their expressions using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH). We show that two genes in a co-regulated DGP have higher expression covariance compared with the separate, tandem and convergent configurations, and this higher covariance is caused by more synchronized firing of the divergent transcriptions. For differentially regulated DGPs, the regulatory signal of one gene can stochastically /`leak/' to the other, causing increased gene expression noise. We propose that the DGPs/' function in limiting or promoting gene expression noise may enhance or compromise cell fitness, providing an explanation for the conservation pattern of DGPs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Numerous microarray studies of aging have been conducted, yet given the noisy nature of gene expression changes with age, elucidating the transcriptional features of aging and how these relate to physiological, biochemical and pathological changes remains a critical problem.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We performed a meta-analysis of age-related gene expression profiles using 27 datasets from mice, rats and humans. Our results reveal several common signatures of aging, including 56 genes consistently overexpressed with age, the most significant of which was APOD, and 17 genes underexpressed with age. We characterized the biological processes associated with these signatures and found that age-related gene expression changes most notably involve an overexpression of inflammation and immune response genes and of genes associated with the lysosome. An underexpression of collagen genes and of genes associated with energy metabolism, particularly mitochondrial genes, as well as alterations in the expression of genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle and cellular senescence biomarkers, were also observed. By employing a new method that emphasizes sensitivity, our work further reveals previously unknown transcriptional changes with age in many genes, processes and functions. We suggest these molecular signatures reflect a combination of degenerative processes but also transcriptional responses to the process of aging. Overall, our results help to understand how transcriptional changes relate to the process of aging and could serve as targets for future studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY: http://genomics.senescence.info/uarrays/signatures.html.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

abstract = {Phenotype of biological systems needs to be robust against mutation in order to sustain themselves between generations. On the other hand, phenotype of an individual also needs to be robust against fluctuations of both internal and external origins that are encountered during growth and development. Is there a relationship between these two types of robustness, one during a single generation and the other during evolution? Could stochasticity in gene expression have any relevance to the evolution of these types of robustness? Robustness can be defined by the sharpness of the distribution of phenotype; the variance of phenotype distribution due to genetic variation gives a measure of 'genetic robustness', while that of isogenic individuals gives a measure of 'developmental robustness'. Through simulations of a simple stochastic gene expression network that undergoes mutation and selection, we show that in order for the network to acquire both types of robustness, the phenotypic variance induced by mutations must be smaller than that observed in an isogenic population. As the latter originates from noise in gene expression, this signifies that the genetic robustness evolves only when the noise strength in gene expression is larger than some threshold. In such a case, the two variances decrease throughout the evolutionary time course, indicating increase in robustness. The results reveal how noise that cells encounter during growth and development shapes networks' robustness to stochasticity in gene expression, which in turn shapes networks' robustness to mutation. The necessary condition for evolution of robustness, as well as the relationship between genetic and developmental robustness, is derived quantitatively through the variance of phenotypic fluctuations, which are directly measurable experimentally.},

Even more paradoxically, an extra copy of the genome is better tolerated than is aneuploidy. We review the resolution of this paradox, highlighting the roles of biochemistry, protein aggregation, and disruption of cellular microstructure in that explanation. Returning to life's curious combination of robustness and sensitivity to dosage changes, we argue that understanding how biological robustness evolved makes these observations less inexplicable. We propose that noise in gene expression and evolutionary strategies for its suppression play a role in generating dosage phenotypes. Finally, we outline an unappreciated mechanism for the preservation of duplicate genes, namely preservation to limit expression noise, arguing that it is particularly relevant in polyploid organisms.},

abstract = {In the three decades since pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were first described they have been derived and maintained by using various empirical combinations of feeder cells, conditioned media, cytokines, growth factors, hormones, fetal calf serum, and serum extracts. Consequently ES-cell self-renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimulation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries, pre-eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines (ref. 8). Here we show, however, that extrinsic stimuli are dispensable for the derivation, propagation and pluripotency of ES cells. Self-renewal is enabled by the elimination of differentiation-inducing signalling from mitogen-activated protein kinase. Additional inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 consolidates biosynthetic capacity and suppresses residual differentiation. Complete bypass of cytokine signalling is confirmed by isolating ES cells genetically devoid of STAT3. These findings reveal that ES cells have an innate programme for self-replication that does not require extrinsic instruction. This property may account for their latent tumorigenicity. The delineation of minimal requirements for self-renewal now provides a defined platform for the precise description and dissection of the pluripotent state.},

We use chemical master equations to analyze a negative feedback system where species X and S regulate each other's synthesis with standard intracellular kinetics. For a given number of X-molecules, S-variation can be significant. We show that this signal noise does not necessarily increase X-variation as previously thought but, surprisingly, can be necessary to reduce it below a Poissonian limit. The principle resembles Stochastic Resonance in that signal noise improves signal detection.},

abstract = {Viral infection can dramatically alter a cell{\&}{\#}039;s transcriptome. However, these changes have mostly been studied by bulk measurements on many cells. Here we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to examine the transcriptional consequences of influenza virus infection. We find extremely wide cell-to-cell variation in production of viral gene transcripts -- viral transcripts compose less than a percent of total mRNA in many infected cells, but a few cells derive over half their mRNA from virus. Some infected cells fail to express at least one viral gene, and this gene absence partially explains variation in viral transcriptional load. Despite variation in total viral load, the relative abundances of viral mRNAs are fairly consistent across infected cells. Activation of innate immune pathways is rare, but some cellular genes co-vary in abundance with the amount of viral mRNA. Overall, our results highlight the complexity of viral infection at the level of single cells.},

@article{Fang2013a,
abstract = {During eukaryotic development, the induction of a lineage-specific transcription factor typically drives differentiation of multipotent progenitor cells, while repressing that of alternative lineages. This process is often mediated by some extracellular signaling molecules, such as cytokines that can bind to cell surface receptors, leading to activation and/or repression of transcription factors. We explored the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper (Th) cells into Th1 versus Th2 states by counting single transcripts and quantifying immunofluorescence in individual cells. Contrary to mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, we observed their ubiquitous co-expression in individual cells at high levels that are distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming. We observed that cytokines are expressed only in a small subpopulation of cells, independent from the expression of transcription factors in these single cells. This cell-to-cell variation in the cytokine expression during the early phase of T helper cell differentiation is significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, we observed the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, thus revealing a weak intracellular network otherwise overruled by the strong signals that emanate from extracellular cytokines. These results suggest that during the early differentiation process CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state, instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components unveiled in Th1/Th2 differentiation may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.},

The great variability of existing pathogens corresponds to a similar high heterogeneity of the immune cells. The study of individual immune cells, the fundamental unit of immunity, has recently trans- formed from a qualitative microscopic imaging to a nearly complete quantitative transcriptomic analysis. This shift has been driven by the rapid development of multiple single-cell technologies. These new advances are expected to boost the detection of less frequent cell types and transient or intermediate cell states. They will highlight the individu- ality of each single cell and greatly expand the resolution of current avail- able classifications and differentiation trajectories.

Using an in situ 3D multiplexed imaging method, seqFISH, we identify unique transcriptional states by quantifying and clustering up to 249 genes in 16,958 cells to examine whether the hippocampus is organized into transcriptionally distinct subregions. We identified distinct layers in the dentate gyrus corresponding to the granule cell layer and the subgranular zone and, contrary to previous reports, discovered that distinct subregions within the CA1 and CA3 are composed of unique combinations of cells in different transcriptional states. In addition, we found that the dorsal CA1 is relatively homogeneous at the single cell level, while ventral CA1 is highly heterogeneous. These structures and patterns are observed using different mice and different sets of genes. Together, these results demonstrate the power of seqFISH in transcriptional profiling of complex tissues.},

abstract = {Following an enzymatic procedure for softening the egg envelope, blastomeres in the embryo of the polychaete Platynereis dumerilii were injected with TRITC-dextran. Injection was successful in the following blastomeres: AB, CD, A, B, C, D, 1a-1d, 1A-1D, 4d, and 4d(1). The distribution of fluorescent label was recorded by confocal laser scanning microscopy of young, three-segmented worms after 3 or 4 days of development, in some cases also in 1-day-old trochophore larvae. Results were documented by single optical sections, by stacking a limited number or a complete set of optical sections, and by computer-generated surface views of both the labeled tissue domains and the body contours from complete image stacks of whole worms. With respect to their descent from the embryonic cell pattern, five major compartments can be distinguished which together compose the body of the young worm: 1) The epispheric, epidermal, and neural region of the head, composed of four domains arranged as quasi-radial sectors derived from micromeres 1a, 1b (left and right ventral), and 1c and 1d (right and left dorsal). 2) A posttrochal epidermal region of the head originating from micromeres 2a(1)-2c(1) and constituting the ventral and lateral posttrochal epidermis of the head. 3) A stomodeal-ectomesodermal region of the head, including the stomodeum (micromeres 2a(2) and 2c(2)), its mesodermal envelope, and head mesoderm (micromeres 3a-3d). 4) A solid cone composed of the four terminal macromeres 4A-4D, forming the core of the trunk as the endoderm anlage. 5) An epidermal and mesodermal coating of the trunk originating from the dorsal micromeres 2d and 4d. The region of the so-called (first, anterior) peristomial cirri at the posterior flanks of the head is also composed of 2d- and 4d-derived trunk tissue, thus corroborating the postulated descent of this region and its appendages from a cephalized anteriormost trunk segment and its parapodia. The cell-lineage domains of the first and third micromere tiers are arranged left or right of the sagittal plane, while two micromeres of the second quartet are in a lateral and, initially, two in a median position (2b ventral and 2d dorsal). The offspring of micromere 2d expand from a dorsal position toward the ventral midline and those of cell 4d from a posterior-dorsal site toward the anterior, initially forming two lateral bands. In the epispheric part of the head, part of the neurectodermal tissue derived from micromeres 1a and 1b interweaves in a medio-sagittal bar, and part of the first micromere offspring of all four quadrants (1a-1d) combine in forming a central brain neuropil. Each of the latter sends neurites through both of the circumesophageal connectives. Paired muscle tracts extend through the head toward the base of the antennae and are probably derived from micromeres 3a and 3b. A mesodermal envelope of the stomodeum is probably built by the 3c and 3d micromeres. The formation of symmetry and the nature of the body axes in the embryo and adult of Platynereis dumerilii are discussed. J. Morphol.},

We applied the technology to dissect the human hematopoietic system and to characterize heterogeneous response to in vitro stimulation. High sensitivity is demonstrated by detection of low-abundance transcripts and rare cells. Under current implementation, the technique can analyze a few thousand cells simultaneously and can readily scale to 10,000s or 100,000s of cells.},

abstract = {Historically, the ribosome has been viewed as a complex ribozyme with constitutive rather than intrinsic regulatory capacity in mRNA translation. However, emerging studies reveal that ribosome activity may be highly regulated. Heterogeneity in ribosome composition resulting from differential expression and post-translational modifications of ribosomal proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) diversity and the activity of ribosome-associated factors may generate 'specialized ribosomes' that have a substantial impact on how the genomic template is translated into functional proteins. Moreover, constitutive components of the ribosome may also exert more specialized activities by virtue of their interactions with specific mRNA regulatory elements such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) or upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Here we discuss the hypothesis that intrinsic regulation by the ribosome acts to selectively translate subsets of mRNAs harbouring unique cis-regulatory elements, thereby introducing an additional level of regulation in gene expression and the life of an organism.},

abstract = {Although it is often tacitly assumed that gene regulatory interactions are finely tuned, how accurate gene regulation could evolve from a state without regulation is unclear. Moreover, gene expression noise would seem to impede the evolution of accurate gene regulation, and previous investigations have provided circumstantial evidence that natural selection has acted to lower noise levels. By evolving synthetic Escherichia coli promoters de novo, we here show that, contrary to expectations, promoters exhibit low noise by default.

Moreover, gene expression noise would seem to impede the evolution of accurate gene regulation, and previous investigations have provided circumstantial evidence that natural selection has acted to lower noise levels. By evolving synthetic Escherichia coli promoters de novo, we here show that, contrary to expectations, promoters exhibit low noise by default. Instead, selection must have acted to increase the noise levels of highly regulated E. coli promoters.

By changing how much protein is produced from each gene (i.e., its expression), many organisms—including humans—can produce a wide variety of cell types with very different behaviors. Similarly, single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, can adapt to survive and grow in different environments by changing gene expression levels. It is thus thought that gene expression must be precisely controlled.$\backslash$nHowever, the molecular processes involved in gene expression are subject to random fluctuations, and so gene expression is inherently ‘noisy'. This means that even groups of identical cells in identical environments will show variation in their gene expression patterns. Furthermore, different genes show different levels of noise. The DNA sequence of a part of each gene, called the promoter, has a big effect on these noise levels. Consequently, gene expression noise is a genetically encoded trait, and can therefore be shaped by natural selection. But it remains largely unclear how natural selection has affected gene expression noise.$\backslash$nNow, Wolf et al. have carefully measured the gene expression noise of hundreds of synthetic promoters that were evolved in the laboratory from random DNA sequences, and a similar number of natural promoters in a bacterium called E. coli. These experiments revealed that, contrary to expectation, most lab-evolved promoters had low levels of noise. On the other hand, many natural promoters had high levels of noise. Wolf et al. also found that noisy promoters tend to be highly regulated by transcription factors: the proteins that control gene expression by binding to promoter regions. Together, these results imply that unregulated promoters start by having low noise as a default state. Selection pressures must then have caused some E. coli promoters to become regulated by transcription factors and raise their noise levels. But, what might these selection pressures have been?$\backslash$nMany genes need to be expressed at different levels in different conditions, and it is generally accepted that regulation by transcription factors evolves to ‘satisfy' these requirements. However, transcription factors are themselves noisy, and this noise necessarily propagates to their target genes. Wolf et al. have now developed a general theory showing that this noise-propagation can often benefit an organism. This explains why natural selection can favor an increase in noise levels for regulated genes. Importantly, by showing that the main role of a transcription factor can be to increase the noise of its targets, it suddenly becomes very easy to see how new gene regulatory interactions can evolve from scratch. The next steps in understanding of how gene expression noise evolves will involve manipulating the expression noise of a gene, and measuring how selection acts on such changes.$\backslash$nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05856.002},

abstract = {Mammalian spermatogenesis-the transformation of stem cells into millions of haploid spermatozoa-is elaborately organized in time and space. We explored the underlying regulatory mechanisms by genetically and chemically perturbing spermatogenesis in vivo, focusing on spermatogonial differentiation, which begins a series of amplifying divisions, and meiotic initiation, which ends these divisions. We first found that, in mice lacking the retinoic acid (RA) target gene Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8), undifferentiated spermatogonia accumulated in unusually high numbers as early as 10 d after birth, whereas differentiating spermatogonia were depleted. We thus conclude that Stra8, previously shown to be required for meiotic initiation, also promotes (but is not strictly required for) spermatogonial differentiation. Second, we found that injection of RA into wild-type adult males induced, independently, precocious spermatogonial differentiation and precocious meiotic initiation; thus, RA acts instructively on germ cells at both transitions. Third, the competencies of germ cells to undergo spermatogonial differentiation or meiotic initiation in response to RA were found to be distinct, periodic, and limited to particular seminiferous stages. Competencies for both transitions begin while RA levels are low, so that the germ cells respond as soon as RA levels rise. Together with other findings, our results demonstrate that periodic RA-STRA8 signaling intersects with periodic germ-cell competencies to regulate two distinct, cell-type-specific responses: spermatogonial differentiation and meiotic initiation. This simple mechanism, with one signal both starting and ending the amplifying divisions, contributes to the prodigious output of spermatozoa and to the elaborate organization of spermatogenesis.},

Here we show that genes commonly expressed in somatic lineages and spermatogenesis-progenitor cells undergo repression in a genome-wide manner in late stages of the male germline and identify underlying mechanisms. SCML2, a germline-specific subunit of a Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), establishes the unique epigenome of the male germline through two distinct antithetical mechanisms. SCML2 works with PRC1 and promotes RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of H2A, thereby marking somatic/progenitor genes on autosomes for repression. Paradoxically, SCML2 also prevents RNF2-dependent ubiquitination of H2A on sex chromosomes during meiosis, thereby enabling unique epigenetic programming of sex chromosomes for male reproduction. Our results reveal divergent mechanisms involving a shared regulator by which the male germline epigenome is distinguished from that of the soma and progenitor cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For many genes, RNA polymerase II stably pauses before transitioning to productive elongation. Although polymerase II pausing has been shown to be a mechanism for regulating transcriptional activation, the extent to which it is involved in control of mammalian gene expression and its relationship to chromatin structure remain poorly understood.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Here, we analyze 85 RNA polymerase II chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing experiments from 35 different murine and human samples, as well as related genome-wide datasets, to gain new insights into the relationship between polymerase II pausing and gene regulation. Across cell and tissue types, paused genes (pausing index {\textgreater} 2) comprise approximately 60 {\%} of expressed genes and are repeatedly associated with specific biological functions. Paused genes also have lower cell-to-cell expression variability. Increased pausing has a non-linear effect on gene expression levels, with moderately paused genes being expressed more highly than other paused genes. The highest gene expression levels are often achieved through a novel pause-release mechanism driven by high polymerase II initiation. In three datasets examining the impact of extracellular signals, genes responsive to stimulus have slightly lower pausing index on average than non-responsive genes, and rapid gene activation is linked to conditional pause-release. Both chromatin structure and local sequence composition near the transcription start site influence pausing, with divergent features between mammals and Drosophila. Most notably, in mammals pausing is positively correlated with histone H2A.Z occupancy at promoters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results provide new insights into the contribution of RNA polymerase II pausing in mammalian gene regulation and chromatin structure.},

Whether X dosage compensation occurs in germ cells is unclear. We show that mouse and human germ cells exhibit non-canonical X dosage states that differ from the soma and between the sexes. Prior to genome-wide reprogramming, X upregulation is present, consistent with Ohno's hypothesis. Subsequently, however, it is erased. In females, erasure follows loss of X inactivation, causing X dosage excess. Conversely, in males, erasure leads to permanent X dosage decompensation. Sex chromosomally abnormal models exhibit a “sex-reversed” X dosage state: XX males, like XX females, develop X dosage excess, while XO females, like XY males, develop X dosage decompensation. Thus, germline X dosage compensation states are determined by X chromosome number, not phenotypic sex. These unexpected differences in X dosage compensation states between germline and soma offer unique perspectives on sex chromosome infertility.},

Single cells display highly variable expressions between cells, while cell populations present deterministic global patterns. The mechanisms governing the reduction of transcriptome-wide variability over cell ensemble size, however, remain largely unknown. To investigate transcriptome-wide variability of single cells to different sizes of cell populations, we examined RNA-Seq datasets of 6 mammalian cell types. Our statistical analyses show, for each cell type, increasing cell ensemble size reduces scatter in transcriptome-wide expressions and noise (variance over square mean) values, with corresponding increases in Pearson and Spearman correlations. Next, accounting for technical variability by the removal of lowly expressed transcripts, we demonstrate that transcriptome-wide variability reduces, approximating the law of large numbers. Subsequent analyses reveal that the entire gene expressions of cell populations and only the highly expressed portion of single cells are Gaussian distributed, following the central limit theorem.},

In this study on 230 monozygotic twin pairs (MZ pairs), aged 18-89 years, we investigated the occurrence of epigenetic changes over the adult lifespan. Using mass spectrometry, we investigated variation in global (LINE1) DNA methylation and in DNA methylation at INS, KCNQ1OT1, IGF2, GNASAS, ABCA1, LEP, and CRH, candidate loci for common diseases. Except for KCNQ1OT1, interindividual variation in locus-specific DNA methylation was larger in old individuals than in young individuals, ranging from 1.2-fold larger at ABCA1 (P = 0.010) to 1.6-fold larger at INS (P = 3.7 × 10(-07) ). Similarly, there was more within-MZ-pair discordance in old as compared with young MZ pairs, except for GNASAS, ranging from an 8{\%} increase in discordance each decade at CRH (P = 8.9 × 10(-06) ) to a 16{\%} increase each decade at LEP (P = 2.0 × 10(-08) ). Still, old MZ pairs with strikingly similar DNA methylation were also observed at these loci. After 10-year follow-up in elderly twins, the variation in DNA methylation showed a similar pattern of change as observed cross-sectionally. The age-related increase in methylation variation was generally attributable to unique environmental factors, except for CRH, for which familial factors may play a more important role. In conclusion, sustained epigenetic differences arise from early adulthood to old age and contribute to an increasing discordance of MZ twins during aging.},

Although highly conserved, the functional properties of promoters with different shapes and the genetic basis of their evolution remain unclear. Here we used natural genetic variation across a panel of 81 Drosophila lines to measure changes in transcriptional start site (TSS) usage, identifying thousands of genetic variants affecting transcript levels (strength) or the distribution of TSSs within a promoter (shape). Our results identify promoter shape as a molecular trait that can evolve independently of promoter strength. Broad promoters typically harbor shape-associated variants, with signatures of adaptive selection. Single-cell measurements demonstrate that variants modulating promoter shape often increase expression noise, whereas heteroallelic interactions with other promoter variants alleviate these effects. These results uncover new functional properties of natural promoters and suggest the minimization of expression noise as an important factor in promoter evolution.},

abstract = {Certain types of cellular differentiation are probabilistic and transient. In such systems individual cells can switch to an alternative state and, after some time, switch back again. In Bacillus subtilis, competence is an example of such a transiently differentiated state associated with the capability for DNA uptake from the environment. Individual genes and proteins underlying differentiation into the competent state have been identified, but it has been unclear how these genes interact dynamically in individual cells to control both spontaneous entry into competence and return to vegetative growth. Here we show that this behaviour can be understood in terms of excitability in the underlying genetic circuit. Using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we directly observed the activities of multiple circuit components simultaneously in individual cells, and analysed the resulting data in terms of a mathematical model. We find that an excitable core module containing positive and negative feedback loops can explain both entry into, and exit from, the competent state. We further tested this model by analysing initiation in sister cells, and by re-engineering the gene circuit to specifically block exit. Excitable dynamics driven by noise naturally generate stochastic and transient responses, thereby providing an ideal mechanism for competence regulation.},

abstract = {Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a crucial epigenetic mark of heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing. G9a is a major mammalian H3K9 methyltransferase at euchromatin and is essential for mouse embryogenesis. Here we describe the roles of G9a in germ cell development. Mutant mice in which G9a is specifically inactivated in the germ-lineage displayed sterility due to a drastic loss of mature gametes. G9a-deficient germ cells exhibited perturbation of synchronous synapsis in meiotic prophase. Importantly, mono- and di-methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me1 and 2) in G9a-deficient germ cells were significantly reduced and G9a-regulated genes were overexpressed during meiosis, suggesting that G9a-mediated epigenetic gene silencing is crucial for proper meiotic prophase progression. Finally, we show that H3K9me1 and 2 are dynamically and sex-differentially regulated during the meiotic prophase. This genetic and biochemical evidence strongly suggests that a specific set of H3K9 methyltransferase(s) and demethylase(s) coordinately regulate gametogenesis.},

abstract = {Cells must respond sensitively to time-varying inputs in complex signaling environments. To understand how signaling networks process dynamic inputs into gene expression outputs and the role of noise in cellular information processing, we studied the immune pathway NF-??B under periodic cytokine inputs using microfluidic single-cell measurements and stochastic modeling. We find that NF-??B dynamics in fibroblasts synchronize with oscillating TNF signal and become entrained, leading to significantly increased NF-??B oscillation amplitude and mRNA output compared to non-entrained response. Simulations show that intrinsic biochemical noise in individual cells improves NF-??B oscillation and entrainment, whereas cell-to-cell variability in NF-??B natural frequency creates population robustness, together enabling entrainment over a wider range of dynamic inputs. This wide range is confirmed by experiments where entrained cells were measured under all input periods. These results indicate that synergy between oscillation and noise allows cells to achieve efficient gene expression in dynamically changing signaling environments.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, diploid cells give rise to haploid cells via meiosis, a program of two cell divisions preceded by one round of DNA replication. Although key molecular components of the meiotic apparatus are highly conserved among eukaryotes, the mechanisms responsible for initiating the meiotic program have diverged substantially among eukaryotes. This raises a related question in animals with two distinct sexes: Within a given species, are similar or different mechanisms of meiotic initiation used in the male and female germ lines? In mammals, this question is underscored by dramatic differences in the timing of meiotic initiation in males and females. Stra8 is a vertebrate-specific, cytoplasmic factor expressed by germ cells in response to retinoic acid. We previously demonstrated that Stra8 gene function is required for meiotic initiation in mouse embryonic ovaries. Here we report that, on an inbred C57BL/6 genetic background, the same factor is also required for meiotic initiation in germ cells of juvenile mouse testes. In juvenile C57BL/6 males lacking Stra8 gene function, the early mitotic development of germ cells appears to be undisturbed. However, these cells then fail to undergo the morphological changes that define meiotic prophase, and they do not display the molecular hallmarks of meiotic chromosome cohesion, synapsis and recombination. We conclude that, in mice, Stra8 regulates meiotic initiation in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Taken together with previous observations, our present findings indicate that, in both the male and female germ lines, meiosis is initiated through retinoic acid induction of Stra8.},

Pvclust can be used easily for general statistical problems, such as DNA microarray analysis, to perform the bootstrap analysis of clustering, which has been popular in phylogenetic analysis. Pvclust calculates probability values (p-values) for each cluster using bootstrap resampling techniques. Two types of p-values are available: approximately unbiased (AU) p-value and bootstrap probability (BP) value. Multiscale bootstrap resampling is used for the calculation of AU p-value, which has superiority in bias over BP value calculated by the ordinary bootstrap resampling. In addition the computation time can be enormously decreased with parallel computing option.},

@article{McDonnell2009,
abstract = {Stochastic resonance is said to be observed when increases in levels of unpredictable fluctuations--e.g., random noise--cause an increase in a metric of the quality of signal transmission or detection performance, rather than a decrease. This counterintuitive effect relies on system nonlinearities and on some parameter ranges being "suboptimal". Stochastic resonance has been observed, quantified, and described in a plethora of physical and biological systems, including neurons. Being a topic of widespread multidisciplinary interest, the definition of stochastic resonance has evolved significantly over the last decade or so, leading to a number of debates, misunderstandings, and controversies. Perhaps the most important debate is whether the brain has evolved to utilize random noise in vivo, as part of the "neural code". Surprisingly, this debate has been for the most part ignored by neuroscientists, despite much indirect evidence of a positive role for noise in the brain. We explore some of the reasons for this and argue why it would be more surprising if the brain did not exploit randomness provided by noise--via stochastic resonance or otherwise--than if it did. We also challenge neuroscientists and biologists, both computational and experimental, to embrace a very broad definition of stochastic resonance in terms of signal-processing "noise benefits", and to devise experiments aimed at verifying that random variability can play a functional role in the brain, nervous system, or other areas of biology.},

While providing appealing flexibility, this approach makes it difficult to impose or assess structural constraints such as conditional independence. We propose a framework for learning representations that relies on Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes and whose search space is constrained via kernel-based measures of independence. In particular, our method employs the {\$}d{\$}-variable Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (dHSIC) to enforce independence between the latent representations and arbitrary nuisance factors. We show how to apply this method to a range of problems, including the problems of learning invariant representations and the learning of interpretable representations. We also present a full-fledged application to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). In this setting the biological signal in mixed in complex ways with sequencing errors and sampling effects. We show that our method out-performs the state-of-the-art in this domain.},

abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION False discovery rate (FDR) is defined as the expected percentage of false positives among all the claimed positives. In practice, with the true FDR unknown, an estimated FDR can serve as a criterion to evaluate the performance of various statistical methods under the condition that the estimated FDR approximates the true FDR well, or at least, it does not improperly favor or disfavor any particular method. Permutation methods have become popular to estimate FDR in genomic studies. The purpose of this paper is 2-fold. First, we investigate theoretically and empirically whether the standard permutation-based FDR estimator is biased, and if so, whether the bias inappropriately favors or disfavors any method. Second, we propose a simple modification of the standard permutation to yield a better FDR estimator, which can in turn serve as a more fair criterion to evaluate various statistical methods. RESULTS Both simulated and real data examples are used for illustration and comparison. Three commonly used test statistics, the sample mean, SAM statistic and Student's t-statistic, are considered. The results show that the standard permutation method overestimates FDR. The overestimation is the most severe for the sample mean statistic while the least for the t-statistic with the SAM-statistic lying between the two extremes, suggesting that one has to be cautious when using the standard permutation-based FDR estimates to evaluate various statistical methods. In addition, our proposed FDR estimation method is simple and outperforms the standard method.},

abstract = {Formation and patterning of the vertebrate embryo occur in a head-to-tail sequence. This progressive mode of body formation from the posterior end of the embryo requires a strict temporal coordination of tissue differentiation--a process involving fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling. Here we show that transcription of fgf8 messenger RNA is restricted to the growing posterior tip of the embryo. fgf8 mRNA is progressively degraded in the newly formed tissues, resulting in the formation of an mRNA gradient in the posterior part of the embryo. This fgf8 mRNA gradient is translated into a gradient of FGF8 protein, which correlates with graded phosphorylation of the kinase Akt, a downstream effector of FGF signalling. Such a mechanism provides an efficient means to monitor the timing of FGF signalling, coupling the differentiation of embryonic tissues to the posterior elongation of the embryo. In addition, this mechanism provides a novel model for morphogen gradient formation.},

abstract = {Clustering, principal component analysis, clustering stability, gene expression Clustering is one of the most commonly used tools in the analysis of gene expression data. The usage in grouping genes is based on the premise that co-expression is a result of co-regulation. It is thus a preliminary step in extracting gene networks and inference of gene function. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning, i.e. no information on the class variable is assumed, and the objective is to find the "natural" groups in the data. However, most clustering algorithms generate a clustering even if the data has no inherent cluster structure, so external validation tools are required. The emergence of cluster structure depends on several choices: data representation and normalization, the choice of a similarity measure and clustering algorithm. In this chapter we extend the stability-based validation of cluster structure, and propose stability as a figure of merit that is useful for comparing clustering solutions, thus helping in making these choices. We use this framework to demonstrate the ability of principal component analysis (PCA) to extract features relavant to the cluster structure. We use stability as a tool for simultaneously choosing the number of principal components and the number of clusters.},

abstract = {Chromosome synapsis during zygotene is a prerequisite for the timely homologous recombinational repair of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Unrepaired DSBs are thought to trigger apoptosis during midpachytene of male meiosis if synapsis fails. An early pachytene response to asynapsis is meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which, in normal males, silences the X and Y chromosomes (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation [MSCI]). In this study, we show that MSUC occurs in Spo11-null mouse spermatocytes with extensive asynapsis but lacking meiotic DSBs. In contrast, three mutants (Dnmt3l, Msh5, and Dmc1) with high levels of asynapsis and numerous persistent unrepaired DSBs have a severely impaired MSUC response. We suggest that MSUC-related proteins, including the MSUC initiator BRCA1, are sequestered at unrepaired DSBs. All four mutants fail to silence the X and Y chromosomes (MSCI failure), which is sufficient to explain the midpachytene apoptosis. Apoptosis does not occur in mice with a single additional asynapsed chromosome with unrepaired meiotic DSBs and no disturbance of MSCI.},

abstract = {In mammals, specification of the three major germ layers occurs during gastrulation, when cells ingressing through the primitive streak differentiate into the precursor cells of major organ systems. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear, as numbers of gastrulating cells are very limited. In the mouse embryo at embryonic day 6.5, cells located at the junction between the extra-embryonic region and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingress through the primitive streak. Subsequently, cells migrate, either surrounding the prospective ectoderm contributing to the embryo proper, or into the extra-embryonic region to form the yolk sac, umbilical cord and placenta. Fate mapping has shown that mature tissues such as blood and heart originate from specific regions of the pre-gastrula epiblast, but the plasticity of cells within the embryo and the function of key cell-type-specific transcription factors remain unclear. Here we analyse 1,205 cells from the epiblast and nascent Flk1(+) mesoderm of gastrulating mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing, representing the first transcriptome-wide in vivo view of early mesoderm formation during mammalian gastrulation. Additionally, using knockout mice, we study the function of Tal1, a key haematopoietic transcription factor, and demonstrate, contrary to previous studies performed using retrospective assays, that Tal1 knockout does not immediately bias precursor cells towards a cardiac fate.},

abstract = {According to the prevailing view, mammalian X chromosomes are enriched in spermatogenesis genes expressed before meiosis and deficient in spermatogenesis genes expressed after meiosis. The paucity of postmeiotic genes on the X chromosome has been interpreted as a consequence of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI)--the complete silencing of genes on the XY bivalent at meiotic prophase. Recent studies have concluded that MSCI-initiated silencing persists beyond meiosis and that most genes on the X chromosome remain repressed in round spermatids. Here, we report that 33 multicopy gene families, representing approximately 273 mouse X-linked genes, are expressed in the testis and that this expression is predominantly in postmeiotic cells. RNA FISH and microarray analysis show that the maintenance of X chromosome postmeiotic repression is incomplete. Furthermore, X-linked multicopy genes exhibit a similar degree of expression as autosomal genes. Thus, not only is the mouse X chromosome enriched for spermatogenesis genes functioning before meiosis, but in addition, approximately 18{\%} of mouse X-linked genes are expressed in postmeiotic cells.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Here, we provide fundamental insights into early human development by single-cell RNA-sequencing of human and mouse preimplantation embryos. We elucidate conserved transcriptional programs along with those that are human specific. Importantly, we validate our RNAsequencing findings at the protein level, which further reveals differences in human and mouse embryo gene expression. For example, we identify several genes exclusively expressed in the human pluripotent epiblast, including the transcription factor KLF17. Key components of the TGF-$\beta$ signalling pathway, including NODAL, GDF3, TGFBR1/ALK5, LEFTY1, SMAD2, SMAD4 and TDGF1, are also enriched in the human epiblast. Intriguingly, inhibition of TGF-$\beta$ signalling abrogates NANOG expression in human epiblast cells, consistent with a requirement for this pathway in pluripotency. Although the key trophectoderm factors Id2, Elf5 and Eomes are exclusively localized to this lineage in the mouse, the human orthologues are either absent or expressed in alternative lineages. Importantly, we also identify genes with conserved expression dynamics, including Foxa2/FOXA2, which we show is restricted to the primitive endoderm in both human and mouse embryos. Comparison of the human epiblast to existing embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reveals conservation of pluripotency but also additional pathways more enriched in hESCs. Our analysis highlights significant differences in human preimplantation development compared with mouse and provides a molecular blueprint to understand human embryogenesis and its relationship to stem cells.},

abstract = {Statistical learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and understanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning. The field encompasses many methods such as the lasso and sparse regression, classification and regression trees, and boosting and support vector machines. With the explosion of “Big Data” problems, statistical learning has be- come a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as marketing, finance, and other business disciplines. People with statistical learning skills are in high demand. One of the first books in this area—The Elements of Statistical Learning (ESL) (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman)—was published in 2001, with a second edition in 2009. ESL has become a popular text not only in statis- tics but also in related fields. One of the reasons for ESL's popularity is its relatively accessible style. But ESL is intended for individuals with ad- vanced training in the mathematical sciences. An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) arose from the perceived need for a broader and less tech- nical treatment of these topics. In this new book, we cover many of the same topics as ESL, but we concentrate more on the applications of the methods and less on the mathematical details. We have created labs illus- trating how to implement each of the statistical learning methods using the popular statistical software package R. These labs provide the reader with valuable hands-on experience. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduates or master's stu- dents in statistics or related quantitative fields or for individuals in other disciplines who wish to use statistical learning tools to analyze their data. It can be used as a textbook for a course spanning one or two semesters. We would like to thank several readers for valuable comments on prelim- inary drafts of this book: Pallavi Basu, Alexandra Chouldechova, Patrick Danaher, Will Fithian, Luella Fu, Sam Gross, Max Grazier G'Sell, Court- ney Paulson, Xinghao Qiao, Elisa Sheng, Noah Simon, Kean Ming Tan, and Xin Lu Tan.},

abstract = {In recent years, a great many methods of learning from multi-view data by considering the diversity of different views have been proposed. These views may be obtained from multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying to organize and highlight similarities and differences between the variety of multi-view learning approaches, we review a number of representative multi-view learning algorithms in different areas and classify them into three groups: 1) co-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace learning. Notably, co-training style algorithms train alternately to maximize the mutual agreement on two distinct views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms exploit kernels that naturally correspond to different views and combine kernels either linearly or non-linearly to improve learning performance; and subspace learning algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by multiple views by assuming that the input views are generated from this latent subspace. Though there is significant variance in the approaches to integrating multiple views to improve learning performance, they mainly exploit either the consensus principle or the complementary principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning. Since accessing multiple views is the fundament of multi-view learning, with the exception of study on learning a model from multiple views, it is also valuable to study how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these views. Overall, by exploring the consistency and complementary properties of different views, multi-view learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has better generalization ability than single-view learning.},

We used a novel variation of the subtractive hybridization technique called stepwise subtraction, wherein the subtraction process is systematically repeated in a stepwise manner. We named the genes thus identified as TISP genes (transcript induced in spermiogenesis). The transcription of 80 of these TISP genes is almost completely specific to the testis. This transcription is abruptly turned on after 17 days of age, when the mice enter puberty and spermiogenesis is initiated. Considering that the most advanced cells present at these stages of spermatogenesis are the spermatids, it is likely that we could isolate most of the spermatid-specific genes. DNA sequencing revealed that about half the TISP genes are novel and uncharacterized genes, confirming the utility of the stepwise subtraction approach for gene discovery.},

Elderly individuals are more susceptible to new threats and are less able to control endogenous infections. The thymus, which is the sole source of new T cells, has been proposed as a target for regenerative efforts to improve immune competence, as thymic activity is dramatically reduced after puberty. In this review, we review the role of the thymus in the maintenance of T cell homeostasis throughout life and contrast the differences in mice and humans. We propose that in humans, lack of thymic T cell generation does not explain a decline in T cell receptor diversity nor would thymic rejuvenation restore diversity. Initial studies using next generation sequencing are beginning to establish lower boundaries of T cell receptor diversity. With increasing sequencing depth and the development of new statistical models, we are now in the position to test this model and to assess the impact of age on T cell diversity and clonality. ?? 2014.},

It is unknown whether similar bursts and gene-expression noise occur in mammalian tissues. To address this, we combine single molecule transcript counting with dual-color labeling and quantification of nascent mRNA to characterize promoter states, transcription rates, and transcript lifetimes in the intact mouse liver. We find that liver gene expression is highly bursty, with promoters stochastically switching between transcriptionally active and inactive states. Promoters of genes with short mRNA lifetimes are active longer, facilitating rapid response while reducing burst-associated noise. Moreover, polyploid hepatocytes exhibit less noise than diploid hepatocytes, suggesting a possible benefit to liver polyploidy. Thus, temporal averaging and liver polyploidy dampen the intrinsic variability associated with transcriptional bursts. Our approach can be used to study transcriptional bursting in diverse mammalian tissues.},

Organoids closely recapitulate several properties of the original tumor. The spectrum of genetic changes within the "living biobank" agrees well with previous large-scale mutational analyses of CRC. Gene expression analysis indicates that the major CRC molecular subtypes are represented. Tumor organoids are amenable to high-throughput drug screens allowing detection of gene-drug associations. As an example, a single organoid culture was exquisitely sensitive to Wnt secretion (porcupine) inhibitors and carried a mutation in the negative Wnt feedback regulator RNF43, rather than in APC.

This second form of X-inactivation, called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) has emerged as a novel paradigm for studying the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. New studies have revealed that MSCI is a special example of a more general mechanism called meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC), which silences chromosomes that fail to pair with their homologous partners and, in doing so, may protect against aneuploidy in subsequent generations. Furthermore, failure in MSCI is emerging as an important etiological factor in meiotic sterility.},

abstract = {Understanding the structure-function relationships at cellular, circuit, and organ-wide scale requires 3D anatomical and phenotypical maps, currently unavailable for many organs across species. At the root of this knowledge gap is the absence of a method that enables whole-organ imaging. Herein, we present techniques for tissue clearing in which whole organs and bodies are rendered macromolecule-permeable and optically transparent, thereby exposing their cellular structure with intact connectivity. We describe PACT (passive clarity technique), a protocol for passive tissue clearing and immunostaining of intact organs; RIMS (refractive index matching solution), a mounting media for imaging thick tissue; and PARS (perfusion-assisted agent release in situ), a method for whole-body clearing and immunolabeling. We show that in rodents PACT, RIMS, and PARS are compatible with endogenous-fluorescence, immunohistochemistry, RNA single-molecule FISH, long-term storage, and microscopy with cellular and subcellular resolution. These methods are applicable for high-resolution, high-content mapping and phenotyping of normal and pathological elements within intact organs and bodies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The mammalian immune system is tasked with protecting the host against a broad range of threats. Understanding how immune populations leverage cellular diversity to achieve this breadth and flexibility, particularly during dynamic processes such as differentiation and antigenic response, is a core challenge that is well suited for single cell analysis. Recent years have witnessed transformative and intersecting advances in nanofabrication and genomics that enable deep profiling of individual cells, affording exciting opportunities to study heterogeneity in the immune response at an unprecedented scope. In light of these advances, here we review recent work exploring how immune populations generate and leverage cellular heterogeneity at multiple molecular and phenotypic levels. Additionally, we highlight opportunities for single cell technologies to shed light on the causes and consequences of heterogeneity in the immune system. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neural synchronization is a mechanism whereby functionally specific brain regions establish transient networks for perception, cognition, and action. Direct addition of weak noise (fast random fluctuations) to various neural systems enhances synchronization through the mechanism of stochastic resonance (SR). Moreover, SR also occurs in human perception, cognition, and action. Perception, cognition, and action are closely correlated with, and may depend upon, synchronized oscillations within specialized brain networks. We tested the hypothesis that SR-mediated neural synchronization occurs within and between functionally relevant brain areas and thus could be responsible for behavioral SR. We measured the 40-Hz transient response of the human auditory cortex to brief pure tones. This response arises when the ongoing, random-phase, 40-Hz activity of a group of tuned neurons in the auditory cortex becomes synchronized in response to the onset of an above-threshold sound at its "preferred" frequency. We presented a stream of near-threshold standard sounds in various levels of added broadband noise and measured subjects' 40-Hz response to the standards in a deviant-detection paradigm using high-density EEG. We used independent component analysis and dipole fitting to locate neural sources of the 40-Hz response in bilateral auditory cortex, left posterior cingulate cortex and left superior frontal gyrus. We found that added noise enhanced the 40-Hz response in all these areas. Moreover, added noise also increased the synchronization between these regions in alpha and gamma frequency bands both during and after the 40-Hz response. Our results demonstrate neural SR in several functionally specific brain regions, including areas not traditionally thought to contribute to the auditory 40-Hz transient response. In addition, we demonstrated SR in the synchronization between these brain regions. Thus, both intra- and inter-regional synchronization of neural activity are facilitated by the addition of moderate amounts of random noise. Because the noise levels in the brain fluctuate with arousal system activity, particularly across sleep-wake cycles, optimal neural noise levels, and thus SR, could be involved in optimizing the formation of task-relevant brain networks at several scales under normal conditions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whole genome amplification (WGA) and laser assisted micro-dissection represent two recently developed technologies that can greatly advance biological and medical research. WGA allows the analysis of multiple genomic loci from a single genome and has been performed on single cells from cell suspensions and from enzymatically-digested tissues. Laser micro-dissection makes it possible to isolate specific single cells from heterogeneous tissues. RESULTS: Here we applied for the first time WGA on laser micro-dissected single cells from stained tissue sections, and developed a protocol for sequentially performing the two procedures. The combined procedure allows correlating the cell's genome with its natural morphology and precise anatomical position. From each cell we amplified 122 genomic and mitochondrial loci. In cells obtained from fresh tissue sections, 64.5{\%} of alleles successfully amplified to approximately 700000 copies each, and mitochondrial DNA was amplified successfully in all cells. Multiplex PCR amplification and analysis of cells from pre-stored sections yielded significantly poorer results. Sequencing and capillary electrophoresis of WGA products allowed detection of slippage mutations in microsatellites (MS), and point mutations in P53. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive genomic analysis of single cells from stained tissue sections opens new research opportunities for cell lineage and depth analyses, genome-wide mutation surveys, and other single cell assays.},

abstract = {Tissue integrity relies on barriers formed between epithelial cells. In the testis, the barrier is formed at the initiation of puberty by a tight junction complex between adjacent Sertoli cells, thereby defining an adluminal compartment where meiosis and spermiogenesis occur. Claudin 11 is an obligatory protein for tight junction formation and barrier integrity in the testis. It is expressed by Sertoli cells, and spermatogenesis does not proceed beyond meiosis in its absence, resulting in male sterility. Sertoli cell maturation--arrest of proliferation and expression of proteins to support germ cell development--parallels tight junction assembly; however, the pathophysiology underlying the loss of tight junctions in the mature testis remains largely undefined. Here, using immunohistochemistry and microarrays we demonstrate that adult Cldn11(-/-) mouse Sertoli cells can proliferate while maintaining expression of mature markers. Sertoli cells detach from the basement membrane, acquire a fibroblast cell shape, are eliminated through the lumen together with apoptotic germ cells, and are found in epididymis. These changes are associated with tight junction regulation as well as actin-related and cell cycle gene expression. Thus, Cldn11(-/-) Sertoli cells exhibit a unique phenotype whereby loss of tight junction integrity results in loss of the epithelial phenotype.},

Here we present an epigenome-wide association study across 406,365 CpGs in 52 monozygotic twin pairs discordant for T1D in three immune effector cell types. We observe a substantial enrichment of differentially variable CpG positions (DVPs) in T1D twins when compared with their healthy co-twins and when compared with healthy, unrelated individuals. These T1D-associated DVPs are found to be temporally stable and enriched at gene regulatory elements. Integration with cell type-specific gene regulatory circuits highlight pathways involved in immune cell metabolism and the cell cycle, including mTOR signalling. Evidence from cord blood of newborns who progress to overt T1D suggests that the DVPs likely emerge after birth. Our findings, based on 772 methylomes, implicate epigenetic changes that could contribute to disease pathogenesis in T1D.},

abstract = {T cell Ig and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a newly identified receptor expressed on T cells that binds to CD155 on the dendritic cell surface, driving them to a more tolerogenic phenotype. Given that TIGIT contains an ITIM motif in its intracellular domain and considering the potential importance of the TIGIT/CD226 pathway in human autoimmune disease, we investigated the specific role of TIGIT in human CD4(+) T cells. Using an agonistic anti-TIGIT mAb, we demonstrate a direct inhibitory effect on T cell proliferation with a decrease in expression of T-bet, GATA3, IFN regulatory factor 4, and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor c with inhibition of cytokine production, predominantly IFN-$\gamma$. Knockdown of TIGIT expression by short hairpin RNA resulted in an increase of both T-bet and IFN-$\gamma$ mRNA and protein expression with concomitant decrease in IL-10 expression. Increases in IFN-$\gamma$ with TIGIT knockdown could be overcome by blocking CD226 signaling, indicating that TIGIT exerts immunosuppressive effects by competing with CD226 for the same CD155 ligand. These data demonstrate that TIGIT can inhibit T cell functions by competing with CD226 and can also directly inhibit T cells in a T cell-intrinsic manner. Our results provide evidence for a novel role of this alternative costimulatory pathway in regulating human T cell responses associated with autoimmune disease.},

However, the data is noise-prone due to experimental errors and cell type-specific biases. Current computational approaches for analyzing single-cell data involve a global normalization step which introduces incorrect biases and spurious noise and does not resolve missing data (dropouts). This can lead to misleading conclusions in downstream analyses. Moreover, a single normalization removes important cell type-specific information. We propose a data-driven model, BISCUIT, that iteratively normalizes and clusters cells, thereby separating noise from interesting biological signals. BISCUIT is a Bayesian probabilistic model that learns cell-specific parameters to intelligently drive normalization. This approach displays superior performance to global normalization followed by clustering in both synthetic and real single-cell data compared with previous methods, and allows easy interpretation and recovery of the underlying structure and cell types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By combining single-cell transcriptomics and clonal culture strategies, we characterize two heterogeneous $\alpha$4$\beta$7-expressing lymphoid progenitor compartments. $\alpha$LP1 (Flt3+) still retains T cell potential and comprises the global ILC progenitor, while $\alpha$LP2 (Flt3-) consists of ILC precursors that are primed toward the different ILC lineages. Only a subset of $\alpha$LP2 precursors is sensitive to Notch signaling required for their proliferation. Our study identifies, in a refined manner, the diversity of transitional stages of ILC development, their transcriptional signatures, and their differential dependence on Notch signaling.},

abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a complex sequential process that converts mitotically dividing spermatogonia stem cells into differentiated haploid spermatozoa. Not surprisingly, this process involves dramatic nuclear and chromatin restructuring events, but the nature of these changes are poorly understood. Here, we linked the appearance and nuclear localization of the essential histone variant H2A.Z with key steps during mouse spermatogenesis. H2A.Z cannot be detected during the early stages of spermatogenesis, when the bulk of X-linked genes are transcribed, but its expression begins to increase at pachytene, when meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) occurs, peaking at the round spermatid stage. Strikingly, when H2A.Z is present, there is a dynamic nuclear relocalization of heterochromatic marks (HP1beta and H3 di- and tri-methyl K9), which become concentrated at chromocenters and the inactive XY body, implying that H2A.Z may substitute for the function of these marks in euchromatin. We also show that the X and the Y chromosome are assembled into facultative heterochromatic structures postmeiotically that are enriched with H2A.Z, thereby replacing macroH2A. This indicates that XY silencing continues following MSCI. These results provide new insights into the large-scale changes in the composition and organization of chromatin associated with spermatogenesis and argue that H2A.Z has a unique role in maintaining sex chromosomes in a repressed state.},

Although nuclear retention of mRNA has a regulatory potential, it is considered extremely rare in mammals. Here, to explore the extent of mRNA retention in metabolic tissues, we combine deep sequencing of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions with single-molecule transcript imaging in mouse beta cells, liver, and gut. We identify a wide range of protein-coding genes for which the levels of spliced polyadenylated mRNA are higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm. These include genes such as the transcription factor ChREBP, Nlrp6, Glucokinase, and Glucagon receptor. We demonstrate that nuclear retention of mRNA can efficiently buffer cytoplasmic transcript levels from noise that emanates from transcriptional bursts. Our study challenges the view that transcripts predominantly reside in the cytoplasm and reveals a role of the nucleus in dampening gene expression noise. Bahar Halpern et al. combine whole-transcriptome and single-molecule approaches to demonstrate that a substantial fraction of genes have higher levels of spliced, polyadenylated mRNA in the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm in mammalian tissues. This nuclear retention reduces cytoplasmic gene expression noise created by transcriptional bursts.},

abstract = {We developed a novel Designed Primer-based RNA-sequencing strategy (DP-seq) that uses a defined set of heptamer primers to amplify the majority of expressed transcripts from limiting amounts of mRNA, while preserving their relative abundance. Our strategy reproducibly yielded high levels of amplification from as low as 50 picograms of mRNA while offering a dynamic range of over five orders of magnitude in RNA concentrations. We also demonstrated the potential of DP-seq to selectively suppress the amplification of the highly expressing ribosomal transcripts by more than 70{\%} in our sequencing library. Using lineage segregation in embryonic stem cell cultures as a model of early mammalian embryogenesis, DP-seq revealed novel sets of low abundant transcripts, some corresponding to the identity of cellular progeny before they arise, reflecting the specification of cell fate prior to actual germ layer segregation.},

abstract = {The advent of single cell transcriptome analysis has permitted the discovery of cell-to-cell variation in transcriptome expression of even presumptively identical cells. We hypothesize that this variability reflects a many-to-one relation between transcriptome states and the phenotype of a cell. In this relation, the molecular ratios of the subsets of RNA are determined by the stoichiometric constraints of the cell systems, which underdetermine the transcriptome state. Furthermore, the variability is, in part, induced by the tissue context and is important for system-level function. This theory is analogous to theories of literary deconstruction, where multiple 'signifiers' work in opposition to one another to create meaning. By analogy, transcriptome phenotypes should be defined as subsets of RNAs comprising selected RNA systems where the system-associated RNAs are balanced with each other to produce the associated cellular function. This idea provides a framework for understanding cellular heterogeneity in phenotypic responses to variant conditions, such as disease challenge. Comparisons of transcriptomes between seemingly identical cells show that the transcriptomes have significant biological variation.Cells exhibit 'many-to-one' sets of equally functional transcriptional states that are defined, in part, by pathway constraints that are underspecified in comparison to the number of genes.Cellular contextualization occurs from the influence of the microenvironment and local interactions, suggesting that variation itself is important for system-level function.},

Indeed, they participate in balancing the synthesis of the RNA and protein components of the ribosome itself. An exciting new story is that ribosomal proteins are sentinels for the self-evaluation of cellular health. Perturbation of ribosome synthesis frees ribosomal proteins to interface with the p53 system, leading to cell-cycle arrest or to apoptosis. Yet in only a few cases can we clearly identify the recruitment of ribosomal proteins for other extraribosomal functions.

abstract = {Populations of tumour cells display remarkable variability in almost every discernable phenotypic trait, including clinically important phenotypes such as ability to seed metastases and to survive therapy. This phenotypic diversity results from the integration of both genetic and non-genetic influences. Recent technological advances have improved the molecular understanding of cancers and the identification of targets for therapeutic interventions. However, it has become exceedingly apparent that the utility of profiles based on the analysis of tumours en masse is limited by intra-tumour genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, as characteristics of the most abundant cell type might not necessarily predict the properties of mixed populations. In this Review, we discuss both genetic and non-genetic causes of phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells, with an emphasis on heritable phenotypes that serve as a substrate for clonal selection. We discuss the implications of intra-tumour heterogeneity in diagnostics and the development of therapeutic resistance.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A gene set test is a differential expression analysis in which a P-value is assigned to a set of genes as a unit. Gene set tests are valuable for increasing statistical power, organizing and interpreting results and for relating expression patterns across different experiments. Existing methods are based on permutation. Methods that rely on permutation of probes unrealistically assume independence of genes, while those that rely on permutation of sample are suitable only for two-group comparisons with a good number of replicates in each group. RESULTS: We present ROAST, a statistically rigorous gene set test that allows for gene-wise correlation while being applicable to almost any experimental design. Instead of permutation, ROAST uses rotation, a Monte Carlo technology for multivariate regression. Since the number of rotations does not depend on sample size, ROAST gives useful results even for experiments with minimal replication. ROAST allows for any experimental design that can be expressed as a linear model, and can also incorporate array weights and correlated samples. ROAST can be tuned for situations in which only a subset of the genes in the set are actively involved in the molecular pathway. ROAST can test for uni- or bi-direction regulation. Probes can also be weighted to allow for prior importance. The power and size of the ROAST procedure is demonstrated in a simulation study, and compared to that of a representative permutation method. Finally, ROAST is used to test the degree of transcriptional conservation between human and mouse mammary stems. AVAILABILITY: ROAST is implemented as a function in the Bioconductor package limma available from www.bioconductor.org.},

abstract = {Mathematical statistics uses two major paradigms, conventional (or frequentist), and Bayesian. Bayesian methods provide a complete paradigm for both statistical inference and decision making under uncertainty. Bayesian methods may be derived from an axiomatic system, and hence provide a general, coherent methodology. Bayesian methods contain as particular cases many of the more often used frequentist procedures, solve many of the difficulties faced by conventional statistical methods, and extend the applicability of statistical methods. In particular, Bayesian methods make it possible to incorporate scientific hypothesis in the analysis (by means of the prior distribution) and may be applied to problems whose structure is too complex for conventional methods to be able to handle. The Bayesian paradigm is based on an interpretation of probability as a rational, conditional measure of uncertainty, which closely matches the sense of the word ‘probability' in ordinary language. Statistical inference about a quantity of interest is described as the modification of the uncertainty about its value in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem precisely specifies how this modification should be made. The special situation, often met in scientific reporting and public decision making, where the only acceptable information is that which may be deduced from available documented data, is addressed by objective Bayesian methods, as a particular case.},

The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

abstract = {Transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes during male meiosis (MSCI) is conserved among organisms with limited sex chromosome synapsis, including mammals. Since the 1990s the prevailing view has been that MSCI in mammals is transient, with sex chromosome reactivation occurring as cells exit meiosis. Recently, we found that any chromosome region unsynapsed during pachytene of male and female mouse meiosis is subject to transcriptional silencing (MSUC), and we hypothesized that MSCI is an inevitable consequence of this more general meiotic silencing mechanism. Here, we provide direct evidence that asynapsis does indeed drive MSCI. We also show that a substantial degree of transcriptional repression of the sex chromosomes is retained postmeiotically, and we provide evidence that this postmeiotic repression is a downstream consequence of MSCI/MSUC. While this postmeiotic repression occurs after the loss of MSUC-related proteins at the end of prophase, other histone modifications associated with transcriptional repression have by then become established. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.},

Although high-throughput sequencing has made it possible to examine the genome and transcriptome at unprecedented resolution, extracting useful information from gigabytes of sequencing data still requires substantial computational skills. Additionally, researchers may analyze and interpret the same data differently, generating results that are difficult to reconcile. To address these issues, we developed a coordinated set of pipelines, 'piPipes', to analyze piRNA and transposon-derived RNAs from a variety of high-throughput sequencing libraries, including small RNA, RNA, degradome or 7-methyl guanosine cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and genomic DNA-seq. piPipes can also produce figures and tables suitable for publication. By facilitating data analysis, piPipes provides an opportunity to standardize computational methods in the piRNA field. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary information, including flowcharts and example figures for each pipeline, are available at Bioinformatics online.

abstract = {Transcriptional stochasticity can be measured by counting the number of mRNA molecules per cell. Cell-to-cell variability is best captured in terms of concentration rather than molecule counts, because reaction rates depend on concentrations. We combined single-molecule mRNA counting with single-cell volume measurements to quantify the statistics of both transcript numbers and concentrations in human cells. We compared three cell clones that differ only in the genomic integration site of an identical constitutively expressed reporter gene. The transcript number per cell varied proportionally with cell volume in all three clones, indicating concentration homeostasis. We found that the cell-to-cell variability in the mRNA concentration is almost exclusively due to cell-to-cell variation in gene expression activity, whereas the cell-to-cell variation in mRNA number is larger, due to a significant contribution of cell volume variability. We concluded that the precise relationship between transcript number and cell volume sets the biological stochasticity of living cells. This study highlights the importance of the quantitative measurement of transcript concentrations in studies of cell-to-cell variability in biology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presents two subtypes which have drastically different clinical outcomes, IgVH mutated (M-CLL) and IgVH unmutated (U-CLL). So far, these two subtypes are not associated to clear differences in gene expression profiles. Interestingly, recent results have highlighted important roles for heterogeneity, both at the genetic and at the epigenetic level in CLL progression. METHODS: We analyzed gene expression data of two large cohorts of CLL patients and quantified expression variability across individuals to investigate differences between the two subtypes using different measures and statistical tests. Functional significance was explored by pathway enrichment and network analyses. Furthermore, we implemented a random forest approach based on expression variability to classify patients into disease subtypes. RESULTS: We found that U-CLL, the more aggressive type of the disease, shows significantly increased variability of gene expression across patients and that, overall, genes that show higher variability in the aggressive subtype are related to cell cycle, development and inter-cellular communication. These functions indicate a potential relation between gene expression variability and the faster progression of this CLL subtype. Finally, a classifier based on gene expression variability was able to correctly predict the disease subtype of CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are strong relations between gene expression variability and disease subtype linking significantly increased expression variability to phenotypes such as aggressiveness and resistance to therapy in CLL.},

abstract = {The structure and development of the larval nervous systems of all classes of echinoderms have been described and details of embryonic signaling mechanisms patterning neurogenesis have been revealed experimentally in sea urchins. Several features of neuroanatomy and neural development indicate that echinoids are the most derived group. Here we describe the development and organization of the nervous system of a cidaroid, Eucidaris tribuloides. The cidaroids are one of two major clades of echinoids, and are considered to have features of anatomy and development that represent the common ancestor to all echinoids. The embryos of E. tribuloides lack a thickened animal plate and serotonergic neurons arise laterally, associated with the ciliary band. Although lacking a discrete apical organ, plutei have serotonergic neurons associated with the pre-oral ciliary band joined by a few diffusely arranged connecting axons. Chordin and Hnf6, early markers for oral ectoderm and ciliary band, are expressed in similar patterns to euechinoids. However, an animal pole domain marker, Nk2.1, is expressed in a broader region of anterior ectoderm than in euechinoids. Six3, a proneural marker that is restricted to the animal plate of euechinoids, is expressed laterally in the preoral ciliary band at the same location as the serotonergic neurons. We conclude that the organization and development of the larval nervous system of E. tribuloides retains features shared with other echinoderm larvae, but not with euechinoids. These data support a model in which several distinctive features of euechinoid neural organization are derived, having arisen after the divergence of the two clades of echinoids about 265 million years ago. We hypothesize that differences in the developmental mechanisms that restrict neurogenesis to the animal pole forms the basis for the distinctive neuroanatomy of euechinoids.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.},

abstract = {Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Inc.},

However, these antibodies are difficult to develop and have characteristics indicative of a high degree of affinity maturation in germinal centers (GCs). CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are specialized for B cell help and necessary for GCs. Therefore, the development of HIV bnAbs might depend on Tfh cells. Here, we identified in normal individuals a subpopulation of circulating memory PD-1+CXCR5+CD4+ Tcells that are resting memory cells most related to bona fide GC Tfh cells by gene expression profile, cytokine profile, and functional properties.

abstract = {The sex chromosomes are enriched with germline genes that are activated during the late stages of spermatogenesis. Due to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), these sex chromosome-linked genes must escape silencing for activation in spermatids, thereby ensuring their functions for male reproduction. RNF8, a DNA damage response protein, and SCML2, a germline-specific Polycomb protein, are two major, known regulators of this process. Here, we show that RNF8 and SCML2 cooperate to regulate ubiquitination during meiosis, an early step to establish active histone modifications for subsequent gene activation. Double mutants of Rnf8 and Scml2 revealed that RNF8-dependent monoubiquitination of histone H2A at Lysine 119 (H2AK119ub) is deubiquitinated by SCML2, demonstrating interplay between RNF8 and SCML2 in ubiquitin regulation. Additionally, we identify distinct functions of RNF8 and SCML2 in the regulation of ubiquitination: SCML2 deubiquitinates RNF8-independent H2AK119ub but does not deubiquitinate RNF8-dependent polyubiquitination. RNF8-dependent polyubiquitination is required for the establishment of H3K27 acetylation, a marker of active enhancers, while persistent H2AK119ub inhibits establishment of H3K27 acetylation. Following the deposition of H3K27 acetylation, H3K4 dimethylation is established as an active mark on poised promoters. Together, we propose a model whereby regulation of ubiquitin leads to the organization of poised enhancers and promoters during meiosis, which induce subsequent gene activation from the otherwise silent sex chromosomes in postmeiotic spermatids.},

In contrast to the single-motif CTCF target sites (1xCTSes), the 2xCTS elements are preferentially found at active promoters and enhancers, both in cancer and germ cells. 2xCTSes are also enriched in genomic regions that escape histone to protamine replacement in human and mouse sperm.

abstract = {Genomic analysis provides insights into the role of copy number variation in disease, but most methods are not designed to resolve mixed populations of cells. In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common, very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse 'pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates.},

abstract = {Variable gene expression within a clonal population of cells has been implicated in a number of important processes including mutation and evolution, determination of cell fates and the development of genetic disease. Recent studies have demonstrated that a significant component of expression variability arises from extrinsic factors thought to influence multiple genes simultaneously, yet the biological origins of this extrinsic variability have received little attention. Here we combine computational modelling with fluorescence data generated from multiple promoter-gene inserts in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify two major sources of extrinsic variability. One unavoidable source arising from the coupling of gene expression with population dynamics leads to a ubiquitous lower limit for expression variability. A second source, which is modelled as originating from a common upstream transcription factor, exemplifies how regulatory networks can convert noise in upstream regulator expression into extrinsic noise at the output of a target gene. Our results highlight the importance of the interplay of gene regulatory networks with population heterogeneity for understanding the origins of cellular diversity.},

The origins of this stochastic behavior can be traced to the random transitions among the discrete chemical states of operators that control the transcription rate and to finite number fluctuations in the biochemical reactions for the synthesis and degradation of transcripts. We develop stochastic models to which these random reactions are intrinsic and a series of simpler models derived explicitly from the first as approximations in different parameter regimes. This innate stochasticity can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the behavior of gene-regulatory networks. We introduce a natural generalization of deterministic bifurcations for classification of stochastic systems and show that simple noisy genetic switches have rich bifurcation structures; among them, bifurcations driven solely by changing the rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. We find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice-versa. We derive and solve equations for the mean waiting times for spontaneous transitions between quasistable states in these switches.},

abstract = {Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are self-renewing and capable of differentiating into any of the three germ layers. An interesting feature of mESCs is the presence of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression that may be responsible for cell fate decisions. Nanog, a key transcription factor for pluripotency, displays heterogeneous expression in mESCs, via mechanisms that are not fully understood. To understand this variability, we quantitatively analyzed Nanog transcription and found that Nanog was both infrequently transcribed, and transcribed in a pulsatile and stochastic manner. It is possible that such stochastic transcriptional activation could contribute to the heterogeneity observed in Nanog expression as "intrinsic noise." To discriminate the effects of both intrinsic noise from other (extrinsic) noise on the expression variability of Nanog mRNA, we performed allele-specific single-molecule RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization in a reporter cell line and found that intrinsic noise contributed to approximately 45{\%} of the total variability in Nanog expression. Furthermore, we found that Nanog mRNA and protein levels were well correlated in individual cells. These results suggest that stochastic promoter activation significantly affects the Nanog expression variability in mESCs.},

One important problem is to test the null hypothesis that the mean matrix has a particular structure without ignoring the dependence structure among and/or between the row and column variables. To address this, we develop a generic and computationally inexpensive nonparametric testing procedure to assess the hypothesis that, in each predefined subset of columns (rows), the column (row) mean vector remains constant. In simulation studies, the proposed testing procedure seems to have good performance and, unlike simple practical approaches, it preserves the nominal size and remains powerful even if the row and/or column variables are not independent. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed methodology via two empirical examples from gene expression microarrays.},

However, detailed genome-wide investigations of transcriptome complexity in major mammalian organs have been scarce. Here, using extensive RNA-seq data, we show that transcription of the genome is substantially more widespread in the testis than in other organs across representative mammals. Furthermore, we reveal that meiotic spermatocytes and especially postmeiotic round spermatids have remarkably diverse transcriptomes, which explains the high transcriptome complexity of the testis as a whole. The widespread transcriptional activity in spermatocytes and spermatids encompasses protein-coding and long noncoding RNA genes but also poorly conserves intergenic sequences, suggesting that it may not be of immediate functional relevance. Rather, our analyses of genome-wide epigenetic data suggest that this prevalent transcription, which most likely promoted the birth of new genes during evolution, is facilitated by an overall permissive chromatin in these germ cells that results from extensive chromatin remodeling. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Aging has been associated with widespread changes at the gene expression level in multiple mammalian tissues. We have used high density oligonucleotide arrays and novel statistical methods to identify specific transcriptional classes that may uncover biological processes that play a central role in mammalian aging. RESULTS: We identified 712 transcripts that are differentially expressed in young (5 month old) and old (25-month old) mouse skeletal muscle. Caloric restriction (CR) completely or partially reversed 87{\%} of the changes in expression. Examination of individual genes revealed a transcriptional profile indicative of increased p53 activity in the older muscle. To determine whether the increase in p53 activity is associated with transcriptional activation of apoptotic targets, we performed RT-PCR on four well known mediators of p53-induced apoptosis: puma, noxa, tnfrsf10b and bok. Expression levels for these proapoptotic genes increased significantly with age (P {\textless} 0.05), while CR significantly lowered expression levels for these genes as compared to control fed old mice (P {\textless} 0.05). Age-related induction of p53-related genes was observed in multiple tissues, but was not observed in young SOD2+/- and GPX4+/- mice, suggesting that oxidative stress does not induce the expression of these genes. Western blot analysis confirmed that protein levels for both p21 and GADD45a, two established transcriptional targets of p53, were higher in the older muscle tissue. CONCLUSION: These observations support a role for p53-mediated transcriptional program in mammalian aging and suggest that mechanisms other than reactive oxygen species are involved in the age-related transcriptional activation of p53 targets.},

Antigen-specific T cells exerted dynamic translational control of gene expression that correlated with cell proliferation and stimulation via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR). The translation of mRNAs that encode translation machinery, including ribosomal proteins, was upregulated during the T cell clonal-expansion phase, followed by inhibition of the translation of those transcripts when the CD8(+) Teff cells stopped dividing just before the contraction phase. That translational suppression was more pronounced in terminal effector cells than in memory precursor cells and was regulated by antigenic stimulation and signals from the kinase mTOR. Our studies show that translation of transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins is regulated during the differentiation of CD8(+) Teff cells and might have a role in fate 'decisions' involved in the formation of memory cells.},

Clustering analysis of the transcriptomes of 66 cells demonstrated that initially they are non-distinguishable. Early in the segregation, lineage-specific marker expression exhibited no apparent correlation, and a hierarchical relationship was established only in the late blastocyst. Fgf4 exhibited a bimodal expression at the earliest stage analysed, and in its absence, the differentiation of PrE and EPI was halted, indicating that Fgf4 drives, and is required for, ICM lineage segregation.

Numerical operations on big datasets can be intolerably slow; sketching algorithms address this issue by generating a smaller surrogate dataset. Typically, inference proceeds on the compressed dataset. Sketching algorithms generally use random projections to compress the original dataset and this stochastic generation process makes them amenable to statistical analysis. We argue that the sketched data can be modelled as a random sample, thus placing this family of data compression methods firmly within an inferential framework. In particular, we focus on the Gaussian, Hadamard and Clarkson-Woodruff sketches, and their use in single pass sketching algorithms for linear regression with huge n. We explore the statistical properties of sketched regression algorithms and derive new distributional results for a large class of sketched estimators. We develop confidence intervals for sketching estimators and bounds on the relative efficiency of different sketching algorithms. An important finding is that the best choice of sketching algorithm in terms of mean square error is related to the signal to noise ratio in the source dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the theory and the limits of its applicability on two real datasets.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection method in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2.6 million customers and by analyzing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad-hoc modular networks. .},

Precisely how these differences first emerge and howthey dictate subsequentmolecularand cellular behaviours are key questions in the field. As we review here, recent advances in live imaging, computational modelling and single-cell transcriptome analyses are providing new insights into these questions.},

Stress-related gene expression programmes, characterized by distinct transcriptional mechanisms and high levels of noise in their expression patterns, need to be balanced with growth-related gene expression programmes. A range of recent studies give fascinating insight into cellular strategies for keeping gene expression in tune with physiological needs dictated by the environment, promoting adaptation to both short- and long-term environmental changes. Not only do organisms show great resilience to external challenges, but emerging data suggest that they also exploit these challenges to fuel phenotypic variation and evolutionary innovation.},

abstract = {Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors, the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse. We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally, we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.},

abstract = {Transmembrane-4-L-six-family-1 (TM4SF1) was originally described as a cancer cell protein. Here, we show that it is highly expressed in the vascular endothelium of human cancers and in a banded pattern in the filopodia of cultured endothelial cells (EC). TM4SF1 knockdown prevented filopodia formation, inhibited cell mobility, blocked cytokinesis, and rendered EC senescent. Integrin-alpha5 and integrin-beta1 subunits gave a similar staining pattern and interacted constitutively with TM4SF1, whereas integrin subunits often associated with angiogenesis (alphaV, beta3, beta5) interacted with TM4SF1 only after vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A or thrombin stimulation. TM4SF1 knockdown substantially inhibited maturation of VEGF-A(164)-induced angiogenesis. Thus, TM4SF1 is a key regulator of EC function in vitro and of pathologic angiogenesis in vivo and is potentially an attractive target for antiangiogenesis therapy.},

Consistent with accelerated protein production in these cells, global mRNA profiles revealed that, after cytokines, the most impressive cluster of activated genes encode rRNA-maturation factors. Activation of these genes was ERK-MAPK dependent, accompanied by increased rRNA transcription and faster maturation kinetics, and much greater in effector CD4+ T cells than in naive cells. Ribosomal protein subunit (RPS) synthesis was also ERK-MAPK dependent and increased to match rRNA production, but without evident increase in RPS mRNA. Instead, stimulation promoted polysome loading of RPS mRNA via cis-acting, 5???-terminal oligopyrimidines. These results demonstrate how, in response to extracellular signals, effector CD4+ T cells coordinately increase multiple ribosomal components to accommodate burgeoning cytokine production.},

The transcriptional state of each cell, however, reflects a variety of biological factors, including persistent cell-type specific regulatory configurations, transient processes such as cell cycle, local metabolic demands, and extracellular signals. Depending on the biological setting, all such aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity can be of potential interest, but detecting complex heterogeneity structure from inherently uncertain single-cell data presents analytical challenges. We developed PAGODA to resolve multiple, potentially overlapping aspects of transcriptional heterogeneity by identifying known pathways or novel gene sets that show significant excess of coordinated variability among the measured cells. We demonstrate that PAGODA effectively recovers the subpopulations and their corresponding functional characteristics in a variety of single-cell samples, and use it to characterize transcriptional diversity of neuronal progenitors in the developing mouse cortex},

This heterogeneity has been measured for gene transcription, phosphorylation, cell morphology and drug perturbations, and used to explain various aspects of cellular physiology. In all cases, however, the causes of heterogeneity were not studied. Here we analyse, for the first time, the heterogeneous patterns of related cellular activities, namely virus infection, endocytosis and membrane lipid composition in adherent human cells. We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell, and we derive probabilistic models that can explain and predict most cellular heterogeneity of these activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population context. We find that accounting for population-determined heterogeneity is essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels of cell populations. Finally, we reveal that synergy between two molecular components, focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid GM1, enhances the population-determined pattern of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection. Our findings provide an explanation for the origin of heterogeneity patterns of cellular activities in adherent cell populations.},

Tritiated thymidine was injected into thirty groups of mice. The spermatogonial cells of each group were separated at one hour and then at daily intervals, and the acid insoluble activity of each fraction was measured. This method enabled us to determine the differentiation patterns of mouse spermatogenesis by following the thymidine label with time. It was found that the spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes formed the theta peak with S-phase spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes having a similar sedimentation velocity of 2.1 mm/hr. The beta cells were identified as late pachytenes and diplotene cells, the gamma cells as secondary spermatocytes, the delta cells as earliest spermatids, the kappa cells as spermatids, and the lambda cells as mature spermatozoa.},

abstract = {Pancreatic $\beta$ cell mass for appropriate blood glucose control is established during early postnatal life. $\beta$ cell proliferative capacity declines postnatally, but the extrinsic cues and intracellular signals that cause this decline remain unknown. To obtain a high-resolution map of $\beta$ cell transcriptome dynamics after birth, we generated single-cell RNA-seq data of $\beta$ cells from multiple postnatal time points and ordered cells based on transcriptional similarity using a new analytical tool. This analysis captured signatures of immature, proliferative $\beta$ cells and established high expression of amino acid metabolic, mitochondrial, and Srf/Jun/Fos transcription factor genes as their hallmark feature. Experimental validation revealed high metabolic activity in immature $\beta$ cells and a role for reactive oxygen species and Srf/Jun/Fos transcription factors in driving postnatal $\beta$ cell proliferation and mass expansion. Our work provides the first high-resolution molecular characterization of state changes in postnatal $\beta$ cells and paves the way for the identification of novel therapeutic targets to stimulate $\beta$ cell regeneration.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is one of the most phylogenetically widespread epigenetic modifications of genomic DNA. In particular, DNA methylation of transcription units ('gene bodies') is highly conserved across diverse taxa. However, the functional role of gene body methylation is not yet fully understood. A long-standing hypothesis posits that gene body methylation reduces transcriptional noise associated with spurious transcription of genes. Despite the plausibility of this hypothesis, an explicit test of this hypothesis has not been performed until now.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Using nucleotide-resolution data on genomic DNA methylation and abundant microarray data, here we investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and transcriptional noise. Transcriptional noise measured from microarrays scales down with expression abundance, confirming findings from single-cell studies. We show that gene body methylation is significantly negatively associated with transcriptional noise when examined in the context of other biological factors.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This finding supports the hypothesis that gene body methylation suppresses transcriptional noise. Heavy methylation of vertebrate genomes may have evolved as a global regulatory mechanism to control for transcriptional noise. In contrast, promoter methylation exhibits positive correlations with the level of transcriptional noise. We hypothesize that methylated promoters tend to undergo more frequent transcriptional bursts than those that avoid DNA methylation.},

In this comprehensive study, we have compared the gene expression profiles in CD8+ T cells from aged and young healthy subjects using Affymetrix microarray Human Genome U133A-2 GeneChips. A total of 5.2{\%} (754) of the genes analyzed had known functions and displayed statistically significant age-associated expression changes. These genes were involved in a broad array of complex biological processes, mainly in nucleic acid and protein metabolism. Functional groups, in which downregulated genes were overrepresented, were the following: RNA transcription regulation, RNA and DNA metabolism, intracellular (Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear) transportation, signaling transduction pathways (T-cell receptor, Ras/MAPK, JNK/Stat, PI3/AKT, Wnt, TGFbeta, insulin-like growth factor and insulin), and the ubiquitin cycle. In contrast, the following functional groups contained more up-regulated genes than expected: response to oxidative stress and cytokines, apoptosis, and the MAPKK signaling cascade. These age-associated gene expression changes may be responsible for impaired DNA replication, RNA transcription, and signal transduction, possibly resulting in instability of cellular and genomic integrity, and alterations of growth, differentiation, apoptosis and anergy in human aged CD8+ T cells.},

In particular, we con- sider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the de- scription of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled ex- amples. Specifically, the presence of two dis- tinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algo- rithm's predictions on new unlabeled exam- ples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and un- labeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This},

We investigated the requirement for IL-2 by the relevant three cell types in vivo and found that CD8(+) T cells, rather than CD4(+) T cells or dendritic cells (DCs), produced the IL-2 necessary for CD8(+) T cell memory. Il2(-/-) CD4(+) T cells were able to provide help only if their ability to transmit signals via CD40L was intact. Our findings reconcile contradictory elements implicit in each model noted above by showing that CD4(+) T cells activate APCs through a CD40L-dependent mechanism to enable autocrine production of IL-2 in CD8(+) memory T cells.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence theway in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

The apparent contrast of the central patch was reduced by the presence of the flanking patches for all experimental conditions. A two layer non-linear model for contrast perception accounts quite well for the data. The first layer performs a power function transformation on the contrast signals from the patches.

Comparing nervous system development in annelids to that of other bilaterians could provide valuable information about the common ancestor of all Bilateria. We find that the Platynereis neuroectoderm is subdivided into longitudinal progenitor domains by partially overlapping expression regions of nk and pax genes. These domains match corresponding domains in the vertebrate neural tube and give rise to conserved neural cell types. As in vertebrates, neural patterning genes are sensitive to Bmp signaling.

In yeast, the decision to enter meiosis is made before the single round of DNA replication that precedes the two meiotic divisions.

The mouse Stra8 gene is expressed in germ cells of embryonic ovaries, where meiosis is initiated, but not in those of embryonic testes, where meiosis does not begin until after birth. Here we report that in female embryos lacking Stra8 gene function, the early, mitotic development of germ cells is normal, but these cells then fail to undergo premeiotic DNA replication, meiotic chromosome condensation, cohesion, synapsis and recombination. Combined with previous findings, these genetic data suggest that active differentiation of ovarian germ cells commences at a regulatory point upstream of premeiotic DNA replication.},

Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show that human melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signalling pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the transcription factors JUN and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics in single cells. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression of many of these same marker genes, suggesting the existence of a general program in which expression is displayed in rare subpopulations of cells.},

While expression variation may be a byproduct of, for example, dynamic or homeostatic processes, here we consider whether single-cell molecular variation per se might be crucial for population-level function. Under this hypothesis, molecular variation indicates a diversity of hidden functional capacities within an ensemble of "identical" cells, and this functional diversity facilitates collective behavior that would be inaccessible to a homogenous population. In reviewing this topic, we explore possible functions that might be carried by a heterogeneous ensemble of cells; however, this question has proven difficult to test, both because methods to manipulate molecular variation are limited and because it is complicated to define, and measure, population-level function. We consider several possible methods to further pursue the hypothesis that "variation is function" through the use of comparative analysis and novel experimental techniques.},

abstract = {As embryos develop, numerous cell types with distinct functions and morphologies arise from pluripotent cells. Three research groups have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the transcriptional changes accompanying development of vertebrate embryos (see the Perspective by Harland). Wagner et al. sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 90,000 cells throughout zebrafish development to reveal how cells differentiate during axis patterning, germ layer formation, and early organogenesis. Farrell et al. profiled the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of embryonic cells and applied a computational approach to construct a branching tree describing the transcriptional trajectories that lead to 25 distinct zebrafish cell types. The branching tree revealed how cells change their gene expression as they become more and more specialized. Briggs et al. examined whole frog embryos, spanning zygotic genome activation through early organogenesis, to map cell states and differentiation across all cell lineages over time. These data and approaches pave the way for the comprehensive reconstruction of transcriptional trajectories during development.

abstract = {Individual mammalian cells exhibit large variability in cellular volume, even with the same absolute DNA content, and so must compensate for differences inDNA concentration in order to maintain constant concentration of gene expression products. Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after DNA replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase. Our results provide a framework for quantitatively understanding the relationships among DNA content, cell size, and gene expression variability in single cells.},

abstract = {Gene expression is subject to random perturbations that lead to fluctuations in the rate of protein production. As a consequence, for any given protein, genetically identical organisms living in a constant environment will contain different amounts of that particular protein, resulting in different phenotypes. This phenomenon is known as "phenotypic noise." In bacterial systems, previous studies have shown that, for specific genes, both transcriptional and translational processes affect phenotypic noise. Here, we focus on how the promoter regions of genes affect noise and ask whether levels of promoter-mediated noise are correlated with genes' functional attributes, using data for over 60{\%} of all promoters in Escherichia coli. We find that essential genes and genes with a high degree of evolutionary conservation have promoters that confer low levels of noise. We also find that the level of noise cannot be attributed to the evolutionary time that different genes have spent in the genome of E. coli. In contrast to previous results in eukaryotes, we find no association between promoter-mediated noise and gene expression plasticity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in bacteria, natural selection can act to reduce gene expression noise and that some of this noise is controlled through the sequence of the promoter region alone.},

abstract = {To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},

abstract = {A fundamental question in biology is how sharp boundaries of gene expression form pre- cisely in spite of biological variation/noise. Numerous mechanisms position gene expression domains across fields of cells (e.g. morphogens), but how these domains are refined remains unclear. In some cases, domain boundaries sharpen through differential adhesion- mediated cell sorting. However, boundaries can also sharpen through cellular plasticity, with cell fate changes driven by up- or down-regulation of gene expression. In this context, we have argued that noise in gene expression can help cells transition to the correct fate. Here we investigate the efficacy of cell sorting, gene expression plasticity, and their combination in boundary sharpening using multi-scale, stochastic models.Wefocus on the formation of hindbrain segments (rhombomeres) in the developing zebrafish as an example, but the mechanisms investigated apply broadly to many tissues. Our results indicate that neither sorting nor plasticity is sufficient on its own to sharpen transition regions between different rhombomeres. Rather the two have complementary strengths and weaknesses, which synergize when combined to sharpen gene expression boundaries.},

One of the major contributing factors to this is age-related declines in the immune system that diminish the response o both infections and vaccinations. In order to understand how specific changes in the immune system influence the generation of immunity in older individuals, immunologists have developed aging mouse models that allow for experimental manipulation of immune system components. These models have shown that there are dramatic age-related changes in naive CD4 T cell function that have the potential to impact a myriad of immune responses. In this review, we will summarize these findings on the intrinsic changes in CD4 T cell function and discuss how these changes influence immunity.},

However, the sources of experimental noise in scRNA-seq are not yet well understood. We investigated the technical variation associated with sample processing using the single cell Fluidigm C1 platform. To do so, we processed three C1 replicates from three human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We added unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to all samples, to account for amplification bias. We found that the major source of variation in the gene expression data was driven by genotype, but we also observed substantial variation between the technical replicates. We observed that the conversion of reads to molecules using the UMIs was impacted by both biological and technical variation, indicating that UMI counts are not an unbiased estimator of gene expression levels. Based on our results, we suggest a framework for effective scRNA-seq studies.},

In many cellular systems, changes in chromatin structure due to alterations in histone expression, histone modifications and DNA methylation are characteristic of the aging process and cause or at least contribute to cellular dysfunction in senescence. Here, we review the epigenetic changes in T cells that occur with age and discuss them in the context of canonical epigenetic marks in aging model systems as well as recent findings of chromatin accessibility changes in T cell differentiation. Remarkably, transcription factor networks driving T cell differentiation account for many of the age-associated modifications in chromatin structures suggesting that loss of quiescence and activation of differentiation pathways are major components of T cell aging.},

abstract = {The kinetics of prokaryotic gene expression has been modelled by the Monte Carlo computer simulation algorithm of Gillespie, which allowed the study of random fluctuations in the number of protein molecules during gene expression. The model, when applied to the simulation of LacZ gene expression, is in good agreement with experimental data. The influence of the frequencies of transcription and translation initiation on random fluctuations in gene expression has been studied in a number of simulations in which promoter and ribosome binding site effectiveness has been changed in the range of values reported for various prokaryotic genes. We show that the genes expressed from strong promoters produce the protein evenly, with a rate that does not vary significantly among cells. The genes with very weak promoters express the protein in "bursts" occurring at random time intervals. Therefore, if the low level of gene expression results from the low frequency of transcription initiation, huge fluctuations arise. In contrast, the protein can be produced with a low and uniform rate if the gene has a strong promoter and a slow rate of ribosome binding (a weak ribosome binding site). The implications of these findings for the expression of regulatory proteins are discussed.},

abstract = {Despite recent advances in single-cell genomic, transcriptional, and mass-cytometric profiling, it remains a challenge to collect highly multiplexed measurements of secreted proteins from single cells for comprehensive analysis of functional states. Herein, we combine spatial and spectral encoding with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchambers for codetection of 42 immune effector proteins secreted from single cells, representing the highest multiplexing recorded to date for a single-cell secretion assay. Using this platform to profile differentiated macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the ligand of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), reveals previously unobserved deep functional heterogeneity and varying levels of pathogenic activation. Uniquely protein profiling on the same single cells before and after LPS stimulation identified a role for macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) to potentiate the activation of LPS-induced cytokine production. Advanced clustering analysis identified functional subsets including quiescent, polyfunctional fully activated, partially activated populations with different cytokine profiles. This population architecture is conserved throughout the cell activation process and prevails as it is extended to other TLR ligands and to primary macrophages derived from a healthy donor. This work demonstrates that the phenotypically similar cell population still exhibits a large degree of intrinsic heterogeneity at the functional and cell behavior level. This technology enables full-spectrum dissection of immune functional states in response to pathogenic or environmental stimulation, and opens opportunities to quantify deep functional heterogeneity for more comprehensive and accurate immune monitoring.},

abstract = {Naive CD4 + T cells differentiate into specific effector subsets—Th1, Th2, Th17, and T follicular helper (Tfh)—that provide immunity against pathogen infection. The signaling pathways involved in generating these effector cells are partially known. However, the effects of mutations underlying human primary immunodeficiencies on these processes, and how they compromise specific immune responses, remain unresolved. By studying individuals with mutations in key signaling pathways, we identified nonredundant pathways regulating human CD4 + T cell differentiation in vitro. IL12R$\beta$1/TYK2 and IFN-$\gamma$R/STAT1 function in a feed-forward loop to induce Th1 cells, whereas IL-21/IL-21R/STAT3 signaling is required for Th17, Tfh, and IL-10–secreting cells. IL12R$\beta$1/TYK2 and NEMO are also required for Th17 induction. Strikingly, gain-of-function STAT1 mutations recapitulated the impact of dominant-negative STAT3 mutations on Tfh and Th17 cells, revealing a putative inhibitory effect of hypermorphic STAT1 over STAT3. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the requirements for human T cell effector function, and explain clinical manifestations of these immunodeficient conditions. Furthermore, they identify molecules that could be targeted to modulate CD4 + T cell effector function in the settings of infection, vaccination, or immune dysregulation.},

abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic process involving small numbers of molecules. As a consequence, cells in a clonal population vary randomly and sometimes substantially from one another in the concentration of mRNA and protein species, a phenomenon known as gene expression noise. Previous theoretical models of gene expression noise assumed that translation is first-order (linear) in mRNA concentration, leading to unfiltered propagation of mRNA noise to the protein level. Here I consider the biological ramifications of relaxing this assumption. Specifically, I solve for the noise statistics of gene expression assuming that translation obeys hyperbolic, Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to mRNA concentration. I generalize previous stochastic gene expression models by allowing the kinetic order of translation, denoted here by a, to vary continuously from zero-order (a = 0), where ribosomes are fully saturated with mRNA, to first order (a = 1), where ribosomes are unsaturated and mRNA is limiting for translation. In general, hyperbolic translation acts as a high-amplitude filter of mRNA noise. This hyperbolic filtering greatly attenuates the propagation of transcriptional noise to the protein level and qualitatively changes the selective and synthetic targets of noise control. In principle, natural selection or synthetic biologists could exploit this feature to limit or amplify gene expression noise by tuning mRNA and ribosome levels to control the kinetic order of translation.},

abstract = {Combining information from various data sources has become an important research topic in machine learning with many scien- tific applications. Most previous studies em- ploy kernels or graphs to integrate different types of features, which routinely assume one weight for one type of features. However, for many problems, the importance of fea- tures in one source to an individual clus- ter of data can be varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this pa- per, we propose a novel multi-view learn- ing model to integrate all features and learn the weight for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint struc- tured sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoret- ical proof on its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view data sets for both clustering and classification. In all experimental results, our method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Gene recruitment is a mechanism of molecular evolution whereby a gene product can function in more than one distinct capacity. The 'one gene-dual function' phenomenon is well illustrated by crystallins, structural proteins that play both specialized roles in the eye lens and also 'housekeeping' enzyme roles. Ribosomal proteins are integral components of the basal cellular machinery involved in protein synthesis, whose roles have been regarded collectively as important, but individually somewhat mundane. However, various individual ribosomal proteins and also translation initiation and elongation factors have been found to play roles in regulating cell growth, transformation and death, giving rise to increasing speculation that components of the translational apparatus can act as multifunctional proteins. Recently, we have shown that ribosomal protein S3a (RPS3a) plays important roles in cell transformation and death, whereby constitutively or transiently enhanced RPS3a expression can be regarded as 'priming' a cell for apoptosis and suppression of such enhanced expression as 'execution'. While it is unclear whether RPS3a acts in a capacity mechanistically distinct from that in translation, such a possibility is discussed in this article in the light of recent, although not exhaustively reviewed, findings implicating the involvement of other individual ribosomal proteins in modulating and/or effecting changes in cellular responses and growth patterns in an extraribosomal capacity independent of their conventional role in translation.},

In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the scRNA-tools database (www.scRNA-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each scRNA-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for scRNA-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to scRNA-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the scRNA-seq community embraces an open-source approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods. The scRNA-tools database provides a valuable resource for researchers embarking on scRNA-seq analysis and records of the growth of the field over time.},

Here, we report a detailed gene expression map of human spermatogenesis using single-cell RNA-Seq. Surprisingly, we found that spermatogenesis-expressed genes contain significantly fewer germline mutations than unexpressed genes, with the lowest mutation rates on the transcribed DNA strands. These results suggest a model of 'transcriptional scanning' to reduce germline mutations by correcting DNA damage. This model also explains the rapid evolution in sensory- and immune-defense related genes, as well as in male reproduction genes. Collectively, our results indicate that widespread expression in the testes achieves a dual mechanism for maintaining the DNA integrity of most genes, while selectively promoting variation of other genes.},

abstract = {Image-based approaches to single-cell transcriptomics, in which RNA species are identified and counted in situ via imaging, have emerged as a powerful complement to single-cell methods based on RNA sequencing of dissociated cells. These image-based approaches naturally preserve the native spatial context of RNAs within a cell and the organization of cells within tissue, which are important for addressing many biological questions. However, the throughput of these image-based approaches is relatively low. Here we report advances that lead to a drastic increase in the measurement throughput of multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), an image-based approach to single-cell transcriptomics. In MERFISH, RNAs are identified via a combinatorial labeling approach that encodes RNA species with error-robust barcodes followed by sequential rounds of single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) to read out these barcodes. Here we increase the throughput of MERFISH by two orders of magnitude through a combination of improvements, including using chemical cleavage instead of photobleaching to remove fluorescent signals between consecutive rounds of smFISH imaging, increasing the imaging field of view, and using multicolor imaging. With these improvements, we performed RNA profiling in more than 100,000 human cells, with as many as 40,000 cells measured in a single 18-h measurement. This throughput should substantially extend the range of biological questions that can be addressed by MERFISH.},

In 1940, Waddington coined the term "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for pluripotency and differentiation, but methylation landscapes have not yet been rigorously computed. Using principles from statistical physics and information theory, we derive epigenetic energy landscapes from whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data that enable us to quantify methylation stochasticity genome-wide using Shannon's entropy, associating it with chromatin structure. Moreover, we consider the Jensen-Shannon distance between sample-specific energy landscapes as a measure of epigenetic dissimilarity and demonstrate its effectiveness for discerning epigenetic differences. By viewing methylation maintenance as a communications system, we introduce methylation channels and show that higher-order chromatin organization can be predicted from their informational properties. Our results provide a fundamental understanding of the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome that leads to a powerful approach for studying its role in disease and aging.},

abstract = {Complex tissues, such as the brain, are composed of multiple different cell types, each of which have distinct and important roles, for example in neural function. Moreover, it has recently been appreciated that the cells that make up these sub-cell types themselves harbour significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity, in particular at the level of gene expression. The ability to study this heterogeneity has been revolutionised by advances in experimental technology, such as Wholemount in Situ Hybridizations (WiSH) and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Consequently, it is now possible to study gene expression levels in thousands of cells from the same tissue type. After generating such data one of the key goals is to cluster the cells into groups that correspond to both known and putatively novel cell types. Whilst many clustering algorithms exist, they are typically unable to incorporate information about the spatial dependence between cells within the tissue under study. When such information exists it provides important insights that should be directly included in the clustering scheme. To this end we have developed a clustering method that uses a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model to exploit both quantitative measures of expression and spatial information. To accurately reflect the underlying biology, we extend current HMRF approaches by allowing the degree of spatial coherency to differ between clusters. We demonstrate the utility of our method using simulated data before applying it to cluster single cell gene expression data generated by applying WiSH to study expression patterns in the brain of the marine annelid Platynereis dumereilii. Our approach allows known cell types to be identified as well as revealing new, previously unexplored cell types within the brain of this important model system.},

We use synthetic data to evaluate D(3)E, demonstrating that it can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. Since D(3)E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D(3)E to investigate experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression. CONCLUSION Evaluation using synthetic data shows that D(3)E performs better than other methods for identifying differentially expressed genes since it is designed to take full advantage of the information available from single-cell RNA-seq experiments. Moreover, the analytical model underlying D(3)E makes it possible to gain additional biological insights.},

abstract = {Gene expression occurs either as an episodic process, characterized by pulsatile bursts, or as a constitutive process, characterized by a Poisson-like accumulation of gene products. It is not clear which mode of gene expression (constitutive versus bursty) predominates across a genome or how transcriptional dynamics are influenced by genomic position and promoter sequence. Here, we use time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to analyze 8,000 individual human genomic loci and find that at virtually all loci, episodic bursting--as opposed to constitutive expression--is the predominant mode of expression. Quantitative analysis of the expression dynamics at these 8,000 loci indicates that both the frequency and size of the transcriptional bursts varies equally across the human genome, independent of promoter sequence. Strikingly, weaker expression loci modulate burst frequency to increase activity, whereas stronger expression loci modulate burst size to increase activity. Transcriptional activators such as trichostatin A (TSA) and tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF) only modulate burst size and frequency along a constrained trend line governed by the promoter. In summary, transcriptional bursting dominates across the human genome, both burst frequency and burst size vary by chromosomal location, and transcriptional activators alter burst frequency and burst size, depending on the expression level of the locus.},

abstract = {The phenotypic differences between individual organisms can often be ascribed to underlying genetic and environmental variation. However, even genetically identical organisms in homogeneous environments vary, indicating that randomness in developmental processes such as gene expression may also generate diversity. To examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, whereas others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is subjected to a threshold, producing an ON/OFF expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.},

abstract = {Individual cells within a tumour can exhibit distinct genetic and molecular features. The impact of such diversification on metastatic potential is unknown. Here we identify clonal human breast cancer subpopulations that display different levels of morphological and molecular diversity. Highly variable subpopulations are more proficient at metastatic colonization and chemotherapeutic survival. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, inter-cell transcript expression variability is identified as a defining feature of the highly variable subpopulations that leads to protein-level variation. Furthermore, we identify high variability in the spliceosomal machinery gene set. Engineered variable expression of the spliceosomal gene SNRNP40 promotes metastasis, attributable to cells with low expression. Clinically, low SNRNP40 expression is associated with metastatic relapse. Our findings reveal transcriptomic variability generation as a mechanism by which cancer subpopulations can diversify gene expression states, which may allow for enhanced fitness under changing environmental pressures encountered during cancer progression.},

abstract = {Human adult spermatogonial stem cells (hSSCs) must balance self-renewal and differentiation. To understand how this is achieved, we profiled DNA methylation and open chromatin (ATAC-seq) in SSEA4+hSSCs, analyzed bulk and single-cell RNA transcriptomes (RNA-seq) in SSEA4+hSSCs and differentiating c-KIT+spermatogonia, and performed validation studies via immunofluorescence. First, DNA hypomethylation at embryonic developmental genes supports their epigenetic “poising” in hSSCs for future/embryonic expression, while core pluripotency genes (OCT4 and NANOG) were transcriptionally and epigenetically repressed. Interestingly, open chromatin in hSSCs was strikingly enriched in binding sites for pioneer factors (NFYA/B, DMRT1, and hormone receptors). Remarkably, single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis identified four cellular/developmental states during hSSC differentiation, involving major transitions in cell-cycle and transcriptional regulators, splicing and signaling factors, and glucose/mitochondria regulators. Overall, our results outline the dynamic chromatin/transcription landscape operating in hSSCs and identify crucial molecular pathways that accompany the transition from quiescence to proliferation and differentiation. Cairns and colleagues show that human spermatogonial stem cells (hSSCs) bear unique DNA methylation and open chromatin landscapes, which may enable proper development, niche responsiveness, and “poised” pluripotency. Interestingly, single-cell transcriptome and immunofluorescence analyses reveal four cellular states, spanning from quiescent hSSCs to proliferating, metabolically active, differentiating spermatogonia.},

The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: • From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. • Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. • Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the ...},

abstract = {The transcriptional activity during meiotic prophase in the mouse testis is studied with light microscopy and high-resolution autoradiographic techniques using [(3)H]uridine as a labeled precursor. In the present study, two types of RNA synthesis are detected during meiotic prophase: an extranucleolar RNA synthesis of perichromosomal localization and a nucleolar RNA synthetic activity. In some of the autosomes and close to the basal knobs, the activity of the nucleolar organizers is evidenced by the incorporation of [(3)H]uridine into nucleolar masses from zygotene on and at earlier labeling times. The evolution of nucleoli and the formation of a nucleolus attached to the sex pair are described during the different meiotic stages. Perichromosomal labeling, from leptotene on, reaches a maximum during middle pachytene and falls progressively to a low level at longer incorporation times. Sertoli's cell, the most active RNA synthetic cell in the seminiferous epithelium, rises to a maximum of labeling and drops at earlier times compared with the meiotic prophase cells. The condensed sex chromosomes show some scattered silver grains especially at middle pachytene. The axial chromosome cores and synaptonemal complexes are devoid of silver grains during the meiotic prophase. The observations suggest that a control mechanism operates during meiotic prophase to regulate transcriptional activity in the sex chromosomes and to provide differential RNA synthesis in autosomal bivalents at various stages of prophase and within certain segments of the chromosomes.},

abstract = {Gene expression stochasticity plays a major role in biology, creating non-genetic cellular individuality and influencing multiple processes, including differ-entiation and stress responses. We have addressed the lack of knowledge about posttranscriptional con-tributions to noise by determining cell-to-cell varia-tions in the abundance of mRNA and reporter protein in yeast. Two types of structural element, a stem– loop and a poly(G) motif, not only inhibit translation initiation when inserted into an mRNA 5 untranslated region, but also generate noise. The noise-enhancing effect of the stem–loop structure also remains oper-ational when combined with an upstream open read-ing frame. This has broad significance, since these elements are known to modulate the expression of a diversity of eukaryotic genes. Our findings suggest a mechanism for posttranscriptional noise generation that will contribute to understanding of the generally poor correlation between protein-level stochasticity and transcriptional bursting. We propose that post-transcriptional stochasticity can be linked to cycles of folding/unfolding of a stem–loop structure, or to interconversion between higher-order structural con-formations of a G-rich motif, and have created a cor-respondingly configured computational model that generates fits to the experimental data. Stochastic events occurring during the ribosomal scanning pro-cess can therefore feature alongside transcriptional bursting as a source of noise.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Recently, it has been proposed that epigenetic variation may contribute to the risk of complex genetic diseases like cancer. We aimed to demonstrate that epigenetic changes in normal cells, collected years in advance of the first signs of morphological transformation, can predict the risk of such transformation. METHODS: We analyzed DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles of over 27,000 CpGs in cytologically normal cells of the uterine cervix from 152 women in a prospective nested case-control study. We used statistics based on differential variability to identify CpGs associated with the risk of transformation and a novel statistical algorithm called EVORA (Epigenetic Variable Outliers for Risk prediction Analysis) to make predictions. RESULTS: We observed many CpGs that were differentially variable between women who developed a non-invasive cervical neoplasia within 3 years of sample collection and those that remained disease-free. These CpGs exhibited heterogeneous outlier methylation profiles and overlapped strongly with CpGs undergoing age-associated DNA methylation changes in normal tissue. Using EVORA, we demonstrate that the risk of cervical neoplasia can be predicted in blind test sets (AUC = 0.66 (0.58 to 0.75)), and that assessment of DNAm variability allows more reliable identification of risk-associated CpGs than statistics based on differences in mean methylation levels. In independent data, EVORA showed high sensitivity and specificity to detect pre-invasive neoplasia and cervical cancer (AUC = 0.93 (0.86 to 1) and AUC = 1, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the risk of neoplastic transformation can be predicted from DNA methylation profiles in the morphologically normal cell of origin of an epithelial cancer. Having profiled only 0.1{\%} of CpGs in the human genome, studies of wider coverage are likely to yield improved predictive and diagnostic models with the accuracy needed for clinical application. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The ARTISTIC trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN25417821.},

abstract = {FAS belongs to the subgroup of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) family that contains an intracellular "death domain" and triggers apoptosis. Its physiological ligand FASL is a member of the TNF cytokine family. Studies with mutant mice and cells from human patients have shown that FAS plays critical roles in the immune system, including the killing of pathogen-infected cells and the death of obsolete and potentially dangerous lymphocytes. Fas thereby functions as a guardian against autoimmunity and tumor development. FAS triggers apoptosis through FADD-mediated recruitment and activation of caspase-8. In certain cells such as hepatocytes, albeit not lymphocytes, FAS-induced apoptosis requires amplification through proteolytic activation of the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BID. Curiously, several components of the FAS signaling machinery have been implicated in nonapoptotic processes, including cellular activation, differentiation, and proliferation. This review describes current understanding of Fas-induced apoptosis signaling and proposes experimental strategies for future advances. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Aspects of this heterogeneity, such as Nanog expression, are linked to differences in the propensity of individual cells to either self-renew or commit towards differentiation. Recent findings have provided new insight into the underlying causes of this heterogeneity, which we summarise here using Nanog, a key regulator of pluripotency, as a model gene. We discuss the role of transcription factor heterogeneity in facilitating the intrinsically dynamic and stochastic nature of the pluripotency network, which in turn provides a potential benefit to a population of cells that needs to balance cell fate decisions.},

abstract = {Ageing leads to dramatic changes in the physiology of many different tissues resulting in a spectrum of pathology. Nonetheless, many lines of evidence suggest that ageing is driven by highly conserved cell intrinsic processes, and a set of unifying hallmarks of ageing has been defined. Here, we survey reports of age-linked changes in basal gene expression across eukaryotes from yeast to human and identify six gene expression hallmarks of cellular ageing: downregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins; downregulation of the protein synthesis machinery; dysregulation of immune system genes; reduced growth factor signalling; constitutive responses to stress and DNA damage; dysregulation of gene expression and mRNA processing. These encompass widely reported features of ageing such as increased senescence and inflammation, reduced electron transport chain activity and reduced ribosome synthesis, but also reveal a surprising lack of gene expression responses to known age-linked cellular stresses. We discuss how the existence of conserved transcriptomic hallmarks relates to genome-wide epigenetic differences underlying ageing clocks, and how the changing transcriptome results in proteomic alterations where data is available and to variations in cell physiology characteristic of ageing. Identification of gene expression events that occur during ageing across distant organisms should be informative as to conserved underlying mechanisms of ageing, and provide additional biomarkers to assess the effects of diet and other environmental factors on the rate of ageing.},

abstract = {Chromatin structure is central for the regulation of gene expression, but its genome-wide organization is only beginning to be understood. Here, we examine the connection between patterns of nucleosome occupancy and the capacity to modulate gene expression upon changing conditions, i.e., transcriptional plasticity. By analyzing genome-wide data of nucleosome positioning in yeast, we find that the presence of nucleosomes close to the transcription start site is associated with high transcriptional plasticity, while nucleosomes at more distant upstream positions are negatively correlated with transcriptional plasticity. Based on this, we identify two typical promoter structures associated with low or high plasticity, respectively. The first class is characterized by a relatively large nucleosome-free region close to the start site coupled with well-positioned nucleosomes further upstream, whereas the second class displays a more evenly distributed and dynamic nucleosome positioning, with high occupancy close to the start site. The two classes are further distinguished by multiple promoter features, including histone turnover, binding site locations, H2A.Z occupancy, expression noise, and expression diversity. Analysis of nucleosome positioning in human promoters reproduces the main observations. Our results suggest two distinct strategies for gene regulation by chromatin, which are selectively employed by different genes.},

Here we implement single-cell PCR gene-expression analysis to dissect the cellular composition of primary human normal colon and colon cancer epithelia. We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival. We develop two-gene classifier systems (KRT20 versus CA1, MS4A12, CD177, SLC26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard ratios superior to those of pathological grade and comparable to those of microarray-derived multigene expression signatures.},

abstract = {A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) tether cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases and thereby localize phosphorylation of target proteins and initiation of signal-transduction processes triggered by cyclic AMP. AKAPs can also be scaffolds for kinases and phosphatases and form macromolecular complexes with other proteins involved in signal transduction. Akap4 is transcribed only in the postmeiotic phase of spermatogenesis and encodes the most abundant protein in the fibrous sheath, a novel cytoskeletal structure present in the principal piece of the sperm flagellum. Previous studies indicated that cyclic AMP-dependent signaling processes are important in the regulation of sperm motility, and gene targeting was used here to test the hypothesis that AKAP4 is a scaffold for protein complexes involved in regulating flagellar function. Sperm numbers were not reduced in male mice lacking AKAP4, but sperm failed to show progressive motility and male mice were infertile. The fibrous sheath anlagen formed, but the definitive fibrous sheath did not develop, the flagellum was shortened, and proteins usually associated with the fibrous sheath were absent or substantially reduced in amount. However, the other cytoskeletal components of the flagellum were present and appeared fully developed. We conclude that AKAP4 is a scaffold protein required for the organization and integrity of the fibrous sheath and that effective sperm motility is lost in the absence of AKAP4 because signal transduction and glycolytic enzymes fail to become associated with the fibrous sheath. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {The mating pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been the focus of considerable research effort, yet many quantitative aspects of its regulation still remain unknown. Using an integrated approach involving experiments in microfluidic chips and computational modelling, we studied gene expression and phenotypic changes associated with the mating response under well-defined pheromone gradients. Here we report a combination of switch-like and graded pathway responses leading to stochastic phenotype determination in a specific range of pheromone concentrations. Furthermore, we show that these responses are critically dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated regulation of the activity of the pheromone-response-specific transcription factor, Ste12, as well as on the autoregulatory feedback of Ste12. In particular, both the switch-like characteristics and sensitivity of gene expression in shmooing cells to pheromone concentration were significantly diminished in cells lacking Kss1, one of the MAP kinases activated in the mating pathway. In addition, the dynamic range of gradient sensing of Kss1-deficient cells was reduced compared with wild type. We thus provide unsuspected functional significance for this kinase in regulation of the mating response.},

abstract = {Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is widely used in disease models to examine the contribution of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIPK) 1 in cell death and inflammation. We studied three Nec-1 analogs: Nec-1, the active inhibitor of RIPK1, Nec-1 inactive (Nec-1i), its inactive variant, and Nec-1 stable (Nec-1s), its more stable variant. We report that Nec-1 is identical to methyl-thiohydantoin-tryptophan, an inhibitor of the potent immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Both Nec-1 and Nec-1i inhibited human IDO, but Nec-1s did not, as predicted by molecular modeling. Therefore, Nec-1s is a more specific RIPK1 inhibitor lacking the IDO-targeting effect. Next, although Nec-1i was ∼100 × less effective than Nec-1 in inhibiting human RIPK1 kinase activity in vitro, it was only 10 times less potent than Nec-1 and Nec-1s in a mouse necroptosis assay and became even equipotent at high concentrations. Along the same line, in vivo, high doses of Nec-1, Nec-1i and Nec-1s prevented tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced mortality equally well, excluding the use of Nec-1i as an inactive control. Paradoxically, low doses of Nec-1 or Nec-1i, but not Nec -1s, even sensitized mice to TNF-induced mortality. Importantly, Nec-1s did not exhibit this low dose toxicity, stressing again the preferred use of Nec-1s in vivo. Our findings have important implications for the interpretation of Nec-1-based data in experimental disease models.},

This factor is most related to the transactivator Oct-3/4, which is expressed in the early embryo, primordial germ cells, and the egg. However, in contrast with Oct-3/4, rat Sprm-1 is selectively expressed during a 36- to 48-hr period immediately preceding meiosis I in male germ cells. Although the POU-domain of Sprm-1 is divergent from the POU-domains of Oct-1 and Oct-2, random-site-selection assay reveals that Sprm-1 preferentially binds to a specific variant of the classic octamer DNA-response element in which the optimal sequence differs from that preferred by Oct-1 and Pit-1. These data suggest that the Sprm-1 gene encodes a DNA-binding protein that may exert a regulatory function in meiotic events that are required for terminal differentiation of the male germ cell.},

abstract = {Sex chromosomes are uniquely subject to chromosome-wide silencing during male meiosis, and silencing persists into post-meiotic spermatids. Against this background, a select set of sex chromosome-linked genes escapes silencing and is activated in post-meiotic spermatids. Here, we identify a novel mechanism that regulates escape gene activation in an environment of chromosome-wide silencing in murine germ cells. We show that RNF8-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2A during meiosis establishes active epigenetic modifications, including dimethylation of H3K4 on the sex chromosomes. RNF8-dependent active epigenetic memory, defined by dimethylation of H3K4, persists throughout meiotic division. Various active epigenetic modifications are subsequently established on the sex chromosomes in post-meiotic spermatids. These RNF8-dependent modifications include trimethylation of H3K4, histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr), and incorporation of the histone variant H2AFZ. RNF8-dependent epigenetic programming regulates escape gene activation from inactive sex chromosomes in post-meiotic spermatids. Kcr accumulates at transcriptional start sites of sex-linked genes activated in an RNF8-dependent manner, and a chromatin conformational change is associated with RNF8-dependent epigenetic programming. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this RNF8-dependent pathway is distinct from that which recognizes DNA double-strand breaks. Our results establish a novel connection between a DNA damage response factor (RNF8) and epigenetic programming, specifically in establishing active epigenetic modifications and gene activation.},

Previously, two major mechanisms of initiation were considered as essential: prokaryotic, based on SD interaction; and eukaryotic, requiring cap structure and ribosomal scanning. Although discovered decades ago, cap-independent translation has recently been acknowledged as a widely spread mechanism in viruses, which may take place in some cellular mRNA translations. Moreover, it has become evident that translation can be initiated on the leaderless mRNA in all three domains of life. New findings demonstrate that other distinguishable types of initiation exist, including SD-independent in Bacteria and Archaea, and various modifications of 5' end-dependent and internal initiation mechanisms in Eukarya. Since translation initiation has developed through the loss, acquisition, and modification of functional elements, all of which have been elevated by competition with viral translation in a large number of organisms of different complexity, more variation in initiation mechanisms can be anticipated.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}During transcription initiation, RNA polymerase (RNAP) binds to promoter DNA, unwinds promoter DNA to form an RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo) containing a single-stranded 'transcription bubble,' and selects a transcription start site (TSS). TSS selection occurs at different positions within the promoter region, depending on promoter sequence and initiating-substrate concentration. Variability in TSS selection has been proposed to involve DNA 'scrunching' and 'anti-scrunching,' the hallmarks of which are: (i) forward and reverse movement of the RNAP leading edge, but not trailing edge, relative to DNA, and (ii) expansion and contraction of the transcription bubble. Here, using in vitro and in vivo protein-DNA photocrosslinking and single-molecule nanomanipulation, we show bacterial TSS selection exhibits both hallmarks of scrunching and anti-scrunching, and we define energetics of scrunching and anti-scrunching. The results establish the mechanism of TSS selection by bacterial RNAP and suggest a general mechanism for TSS selection by bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic RNAP.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark, yet its functional role is incompletely understood. Attempts to quantitatively associate average DNA methylation to gene expression yield poor correlations outside of the well-understood methylation-switch at CpG islands. Results: Here we use probabilistic machine learning to extract higher order features associated with the methylation profile across a defined region. These features quantitate precisely notions of shape of a methylation profile, capturing spatial correlations in DNA methylation across genomic regions. Using these higher order features across promoter-proximal regions, we are able to construct a powerful machine learning predictor of gene expression, significantly improving upon the predictive power of average DNA methylation levels. Furthermore, we can use higher order features to cluster promoter-proximal regions, showing that five major patterns of methylation occur at promoters across different cell lines, and we provide evidence that methylation beyond CpG islands may be related to regulation of gene expression. Our results support previous reports of a functional role of spatial correlations in methylation patterns, and provide a mean to quantitate such features for downstream analyses.

abstract = {This article reviews results on differentiation, structure, and regulation of Leydig cells in the testes of rodents and men. Two different populations-fetal and adult Leydig cells-can be recognized in rodents. The cells in these two populations are different in ultrastructure, life span, capacity for androgen synthesis, and mechanisms of regulation. A brief survey on the origin, ontogenesis, characterization of precursors, ultrastructure, and functional markers of fetal and adult Leydig cells is presented, followed by an analysis of genes in Leydig cells and the role of luteinizing hormone and its receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases, androgen and its receptor, anti-M{\"{u}}llerian hormone, estrogens, and thyroid hormones. Various growth factors modulate Leydig cell differentiation, regeneration, and steroidogenic capacity, for example, interleukin 1$\alpha$, transforming growth factor $\beta$, inhibin, insulin-like growth factors I and II, vascular endothelial growth factor, and relaxin-like growth factor. Retinol and retinoic acid increase basal testosterone secretion in adult Leydig cells, but decrease it in fetal Leydig cells. Resident macrophages in the interstitial tissue of the testis are important for differentiation and function of Leydig cells. Apoptosis of Leydig cells is involved in the regulation of Leydig cell number and can be induced by cytotoxins. Characteristics of aging Leydig cells in rodents seem to be species specific. 11$\beta$-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase protects testosterone synthesis in the Leydig cells of stressed rats. Last, the following aspects of human Leydig cells are briefly described: origin, differentiation, triphasic development, aging changes, pathological changes, and gene mutations leading to infertlity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Embryonic stem cells (ESC) have the capacity to self-renew and remain pluripotent, while continuously providing a source of a variety of differentiated cell types. Understanding what governs these properties at the molecular level is crucial for stem cell biology and its application to regenerative medicine. Of particular relevance is to elucidate those molecular interactions which govern the reprogramming of somatic cells into ESC. A computational approach can be used as a framework to explore the dynamics of a simplified network of the ESC with the aim to understand how stem cells differentiate and also how they can be reprogrammed from somatic cells.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We propose a computational model of the embryonic stem cell network, in which a core set of transcription factors (TFs) interact with each other and are induced by external factors. A stochastic treatment of the network dynamics suggests that NANOG heterogeneity is the deciding factor for the stem cell fate. In particular, our results show that the decision of staying in the ground state or commitment to a differentiated state is fundamentally stochastic, and can be modulated by the addition of external factors (2i/3i media), which have the effect of reducing fluctuations in NANOG expression. Our model also hosts reprogramming of a committed cell into an ESC by over-expressing OCT4. In this context, we recapitulate the important experimental result that reprogramming efficiency peaks when OCT4 is over-expressed within a specific range of values.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated how a stochastic computational model based upon a simplified network of TFs in ESCs can elucidate several key observed dynamical features. It accounts for (i) the observed heterogeneity of key regulators, (ii) characterizes the ESC under certain external stimuli conditions and (iii) describes the occurrence of transitions from the ESC to the differentiated state. Furthermore, the model (iv) provides a framework for reprogramming from somatic cells and conveys an understanding of reprogramming efficiency as a function of OCT4 over-expression.},

But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution.},

abstract = {Interleukin-2 (IL-2) signals influence various lymphocyte subsets during differentiation, immune responses and homeostasis. As discussed in this Review, stimulation with IL-2 is crucial for the maintenance of regulatory T (T(Reg)) cells and for the differentiation of CD4(+) T cells into defined effector T cell subsets following antigen-mediated activation. For CD8(+) T cells, IL-2 signals optimize both effector T cell generation and differentiation into memory cells. IL-2 is presented in soluble form or bound to dendritic cells and the extracellular matrix. Use of IL-2 - either alone or in complex with particular neutralizing IL-2-specific antibodies - can amplify CD8(+) T cell responses or induce the expansion of the T(Reg) cell population, thus favouring either immune stimulation or suppression.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq mammalian transcriptome studies are at an early stage in uncovering cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, transcript processing and editing, and regulatory module activity. Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

@article{Kluger2003,
abstract = {Global analyses of RNA expression levels are useful for classifying genes and overall phenotypes. Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find "marker genes" that are differentially expressed in particular sets of "conditions." We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive "checkerboard" patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).},

abstract = {Maintenance of the blood system requires balanced cell fate decisions of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Since cell fate choices are executed at the level of individual cells, new single cell profiling technologies offer exciting possibilities to map the dynamic molecular changes underlying HSPC differentiation. Here we have used single cell RNA-Seq to profile over 1,600 single HSPCs, where deep sequencing has enabled detection of an average of 6,558 protein-coding genes per cell. Index sorting, in combination with broad sorting gates, allowed us to retrospectively assign cells to 12 commonly sorted HSPC phenotypes while also capturing intermediate cells typically excluded by conventional gating. We further show that independently generated single cell datasets can be projected onto the single cell resolution expression map to directly compare data from multiple groups and to build and refine new hypotheses. Reconstruction of differentiation trajectories reveals dynamic expression changes associated with early lymphoid, erythroid-megakaryocytic and granulocyte-macrophage differentiation. The latter two trajectories were characterized by common upregulation of cell cycle and oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional programs. Using external spike-in controls, we estimate absolute mRNA levels per cell, showing for the first time that despite a general reduction in total mRNA, a subset of genes shows higher expression levels in immature stem cells consistent with active maintenance of the stem cell state. Finally, we report the development of an intuitive web interface as a new community resource, to permit visualization of gene expression in HSPCs at single cell resolution for any gene of choice.},

They must meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of increased cell proliferation and also adapt to changing environmental conditions, in which nutrients and oxygen may be limiting. An emerging theme in immunology is that metabolic reprogramming and lymphocyte activation are intricately linked. However, why T cells adopt specific metabolic programs and the impact that these programs have on T cell function and, ultimately, immunological outcome remain unclear. Research on tumor cell metabolism has provided valuable insight into metabolic pathways important for cell proliferation and the influence of metabolites themselves on signal transduction and epigenetic programming. In this Review, we highlight emerging concepts regarding metabolic reprogramming in proliferating cells and discuss their potential impact on T cell fate and function.},

Although its real-world relevance was long debated, a number of compelling examples have gradually alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding the model. The RD model can generate a wide variety of spatial patterns, and mathematical studies have revealed the kinds of interactions required for each, giving this model the potential for application as an experimental working hypothesis in a wide variety of morphological phenomena. In this review, we describe the essence of this theory for experimental biologists unfamiliar with the model, using examples from experimental studies in which the RD model is effectively incorporated.},

We developed a quantitative statistical method to distinguish true biological variability from the high levels of technical noise in single-cell experiments. Our approach quantifies the statistical significance of observed cell-to-cell variability in expression strength on a gene-by-gene basis. We validate our approach using two independent data sets from Arabidopsis thaliana and Mus musculus.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler, have provided a Bayesian inference machine in image analysis and in other areas of spatial statistics for several years, founded on the pioneering ideas of Ulf Grenander. More recently, the observation that hyperparameters can be included as part of the updating schedule and the fact that almost any multivariate distribution is equivalently a Markov random field has opened the way to the use of MCMC in general Bayesian computation. In this paper, we trace the early development of MCMC in Bayesian inference, review some recent computational progress in statistical physics, based on the introduction of auxiliary variables, and discuss its current and future relevance in Bayesian applications. We briefly describe a simple MCMC implementation for the Bayesian analysis of agricultural field experiments, with which we have some practical experience.},

abstract = {To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. SPLiT-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing and requires no customized equipment. We used SPLiT-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. Over 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. SPLiT-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.},

@article{Ozbudak2002,
abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spermatogenesis in adult is a complex stepwise process leading to terminally differentiated spermatozoa. The cellular heterogeneity of testis renders complex the studies on molecular aspects of this differentiation process. Analysis of the regulation of adult spermatogenesis would undoubtedly benefit from the development of techniques to characterize each germinal differentiation step. METHODS: Hoechst 33342 staining of mouse testicular cells allows characterization of an enriched population in germinal stem cell and spermatogonia, called side population. In this study, we examined the definition of the various germinal populations stained by Hoechst 33342, notably meiotic and postmeiotic cells. RESULTS: Preleptotene spermatocytes, spermatocyte I, spermatocyte II, and round and elongated spermatids were discriminated by Hoechst 33342 staining. In addition, we associated differentiation of spermatocyte I through leptotene to diplotene with changes in Hoechst 33342 red fluorescence pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Hoechst 33342 staining of viable germinal cells constitutes a valuable tool to study normal and impaired mouse adult spermatogenesis or to isolate viable cells from various differentiation stages for studies of molecular mechanisms regulating spermatogenesis.},

abstract = {Although at the genetic level cancer is caused by diverse mutations, epigenetic modifications are characteristic of all cancers, from apparently normal precursor tissue to advanced metastatic disease, and these epigenetic modifications drive tumour cell heterogeneity. We propose a unifying model of cancer in which epigenetic dysregulation allows rapid selection for tumour cell survival at the expense of the host. Mechanisms involve both genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications that disrupt the function of genes that regulate the epigenome itself. Several exciting recent discoveries also point to a genome-scale disruption of the epigenome that involves large blocks of DNA hypomethylation, mutations of epigenetic modifier genes and alterations of heterochromatin in cancer (including large organized chromatin lysine modifications (LOCKs) and lamin-associated domains (LADs)), all of which increase epigenetic and gene expression plasticity. Our model suggests a new approach to cancer diagnosis and therapy that focuses on epigenetic dysregulation and has great potential for risk detection and chemoprevention.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that cumulative somatic mutations contribute to the aging process by disrupting the transcriptional networks that regulate cell structure and function. Experimental support for this model emerged from a recent study of cardiomyocytes that showed a dramatic increase in the transcriptional heterogeneity of these long-lived postmitotic cells with age. To determine if regulatory instability is a hallmark of aging in renewing tissues, we evaluated gene expression noise in four hematopoietic cell types: stem cells, granulocytes, na{\"{i}}ve B cells and na{\"{i}}ve T cells. We used flow cytometry to purify phenotypically equivalent cells from young and old mice, and applied multiplexed quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to measure the copy number of six different mRNA transcripts in 324 individual cells. There was a trend toward higher transcript levels in cells isolated from old animals, but no significant increase in transcriptional heterogeneity with age was found in the surveyed populations. Flow cytometric analysis of membrane protein expression also indicated that cell-to-cell variability was unaffected by age. We conclude that large-scale regulatory destabilization is not a universal concomitant of aging, and may be of significance as an aging mechanism primarily in nonrenewing tissues.},

We examined phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity in pluripotent stem cell populations, using public gene expression data sets. A high degree of concordance was observed between global gene expression variability and the reported heterogeneity of different human pluripotent lines. Network analysis demonstrated that low-variability genes were the most highly connected, suggesting that these are the most stable elements of the gene regulatory network and are under the highest regulatory constraints. Known drivers of pluripotency were among these, with lowest expression variability of POU5F1 in cells with the highest capacity for self-renewal. Variability of gene expression provides a reliable measure of phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity and predicts those genes with the highest degree of regulatory constraint within the pluripotency network. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Whether T cell maturation is complete at the time of thymic exit has been a subject of debate.

In addition, the relative contribution of CD4 and CD8 recent thymic emigrants was modulated as they entered the peripheral T cell pool. Thus, T cell maturation and subset contribution are both finalized in the lymphoid periphery.},

A key question emerges regarding how this behaviour contributes to tissue phenotype, but it has been a challenge to quantitatively analyse this in living cells over time, as opposed to studying snap-shots of gene expression state. We have used imaging of reporter gene expression to track transcription in living pituitary tissue. We integrated live-cell imaging data with statistical modelling for quantitative real-time estimation of the timing of switching between transcriptional states across a whole tissue. Multiple levels of transcription rate were identified, indicating that gene expression is not a simple binary ‘on-off' process. Immature tissue displayed shorter durations of high-expressing states than the adult. In adult pituitary tissue, direct cell contacts involving gap junctions allowed local spatial coordination of prolactin gene expression. Our findings identify how heterogeneous transcriptional dynamics of single cells may contribute to overall tissue behaviour.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A major challenge is to disentangle these two types of variability and to understand the dynamic processes and mechanisms that control them. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) provide an ideal model system to address this issue because they exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic expression of functionally important regulatory factors. We analyzed gene expression in individual ESCs using single-moleculeRNA-FISH and quantitative time-lapse movies. These data discriminated stochastic switching between two coherent (correlated) gene expressionstates and burst-like transcriptional noise. We further showed that the "2i" signaling pathway inhibitors modulate both types of variation. Finally, we found that DNA methylation plays a key role inmaintaining these metastable states. Together, these results show how ESC gene expression statesand dynamics arise from a combination of intrinsic noise, coherent cellular states, and epigenetic regulation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Caspase inhibitors block this form of apoptosis in many types of cells. However, in several other cell lines, caspase inhibitors switch the apoptotic response to necrosis. A genome wide siRNA screen revealed another member of the RIP kinase family, RIP3, to be required for necrosis. The expression of RIP3 in different cell lines correlates with their responsiveness to necrosis induction. The kinase activity of RIP3 is essential for necrosis execution. Upon induction of necrosis, RIP3 is recruited to RIPK1 to form a necrosis-inducing complex. Embryonic fibroblasts from RIP3 knockout mice are resistant to necrosis and RIP3 knockout animals are devoid of inflammation inflicted tissue damage in an acute pancreatitis model. These data indicate RIP3 as the determinant for cellular necrosis in response to TNF-alpha family of death-inducing cytokines.},

abstract = {Recent technological breakthroughs have made it possible to measure RNA expression at the single-cell level, thus paving the way for exploring expres-sion heterogeneity among individual cells. Current single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocols are complex and introduce technical biases that vary across cells, which can bias downstream analysis without proper adjustment. To account for cell-to-cell technical differences, we propose a statistical framework, TASC (Toolkit for Analysis of Single Cell RNA-seq), an empirical Bayes approach to reliably model the cell-specific dropout rates and amplifica-tion bias by use of external RNA spike-ins. TASC in-corporates the technical parameters, which reflect cell-to-cell batch effects, into a hierarchical mixture model to estimate the biological variance of a gene and detect differentially expressed genes. More im-portantly, TASC is able to adjust for covariates to fur-ther eliminate confounding that may originate from cell size and cell cycle differences. In simulation and real scRNA-seq data, TASC achieves accurate Type I error control and displays competitive sensitivity and improved robustness to batch effects in differential expression analysis, compared to existing methods. TASC is programmed to be computationally efficient, taking advantage of multi-threaded parallelization. We believe that TASC will provide a robust platform for researchers to leverage the power of scRNA-seq.},

Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and "corrupted" developmental processes including cancer. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Mouse pre-implantation development gives rise to the blastocyst, which is made up of at least three distinct cell types: the trophectoderm (TE) that surrounds a cavity, and an inner cell mass (ICM) comprising the primitive endoderm (PE) and epiblast (EPI). However, the underlying mechanisms involved in patterning the cleavage-stage embryo are still unresolved. By analyzing the distribution of the transcription factors Oct4 (Pou5f1), Cdx2 and Nanog at precisely defined stages in pre-implantation development, we were able to identify critical events leading to the divergence of TE, EPI and PE lineages. We found that Oct4 is present in all cells until late blastocyst, gradually disappearing from the TE thereafter. The expression patterns of both Cdx2 and Nanog exhibit two specific phases, culminating in their restriction to TE and EPI, respectively. In the first phase, starting after compaction, blastomeres show highly variable Cdx2 and Nanog protein levels. Importantly, the variability in Nanog levels is independent of position within the morula, whereas Cdx2 variability may originate from asymmetric cell divisions at the 8-cell stage in a non-stereotypic way. Furthermore, there is initially no reciprocal relationship between Cdx2 and Oct4 or between Cdx2 and Nanog protein levels. In the second phase, a definite pattern is established, possibly by a sorting process that accommodates intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Based on these results, we propose a model in which early embryonic mouse patterning includes stochastic processes, consistent with the highly regulative capacity of the embryo. This may represent a feature unique to early mammalian development.},

Here, we describe its spectacular reproduction and development and address a number of open research problems. Oogenesis is easily studied because the oocytes grow while floating in the coelom. Unlike the embryos of other model spiralians, the Platynereis embryo is transparent giving insight into the dynamic structures and processes inside the cells that accompany the prevailing anisotropic cleavages. Functional studies on cell specification and differential gene expression in embryos, larvae, and later stages are underway. Lifelong proliferation of uniform trunk segments qualifies Platynereis as a model for the study of gene expression and of the functional circuitry of this process. Platynereis can also become a stepping stone in the comparison of segmentation between annelids and arthropods because it comes closer to the putative ancestral morphology and style of development than other model annelids.},

abstract = {Aging leads to reduced immunity, especially adaptive responses. A key deficiency is the poor ability to mount robust antibody response. Although intrinsic alterations in B cells with age are in part responsible, impaired CD4 T cell help makes a major contribution to the poor antibody response. Other CD4 effector responses and memory generation are also impaired. We find delayed and reduced development of CD4 T follicular help (Tfh) cells in aged mice in response to influenza infection with reduction of long-lived plasma cells. When we examine CD4 subsets we also find a shift towards Th1 and cytotoxic CD4 (ThCTL) responses. We summarize strategies to circumvent the CD4 T cell defect in aged, including adjuvants and proinflammatory cytokines. We find that we can strongly enhance responses of aged na??ve CD4 T cells by using Toll-like receptor (TLR) activated dendritic cells (DC) as APC in vivo and that this leads to improved germinal center B cells and IgG antibody responses. The enhanced response of aged na??ve CD4 T cells is dependent on IL-6 produced by the DC. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Here we determine that Tfh cell development initiates immediately during dendritic cell (DC) priming in vivo. We demonstrate that inducible costimulator (ICOS) provides a critical early signal to induce the transcription factor Bcl6, and Bcl6 then induces CXCR5, the canonical feature of Tfh cells. Strikingly, a bifurcation between Tfh and effector Th cells was measurable by the second cell division of CD4+ T cells, at day 2 after an acute viral infection: IL2R$\alpha$int cells expressed Bcl6 and CXCR5 (Tfh cell program), whereas IL2R$\alpha$hi cells exhibited strong Blimp1 expression that repressed Bcl6 (effector Th cell program). Virtually complete polarization between Bcl6+ Tfh cells and Blimp1+ effector Th cell populations developed by 72 hr, even without B cells. Tfh cells were subsequently lost in the absence of B cells, demonstrating a B cell requirement for maintenance of Bcl6 and Tfh cell commitment via sequential ICOS signals. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process (GP), a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to training size. To improve the scalability while retaining the desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and discussed in a unifying way in order to be well understood by both academia and industry. To this end, this paper devotes to reviewing state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations which distillate the entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but perform exact inference, and posterior approximations which retain exact prior but perform approximate inference; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and model capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues regarding the implementation of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

abstract = {The contribution of intratumor heterogeneity to thyroid metastatic cancers is still unknown. The clonal relationships between the primary thyroid tumors and lymph nodes (LN) or distant metastases are also poorly understood. The objective of this study was to determine the phylogenetic relationships between matched primary thyroid tumors and metastases. We searched for non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNVs), gene fusions, alternative transcripts, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) by paired-end massively parallel sequencing of cDNA (RNA-Seq) in a patient diagnosed with an aggressive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Seven tumor samples from a stage IVc PTC patient were analyzed by RNA-Seq: two areas from the primary tumor, four areas from two LN metastases, and one area from a pleural metastasis (PLM). A large panel of other thyroid tumors was used for Sanger sequencing screening. We identified seven new nsSNVs. Some of these were early events clonally present in both the primary PTC and the three matched metastases. Other nsSNVs were private to the primary tumor, the LN metastases and/or the PLM. Three new gene fusions were identified. A novel cancer-specific KAZN alternative transcript was detected in this aggressive PTC and in dozens of additional thyroid tumors. The PLM harbored an exclusive whole-chromosome 19 LOH. We have presented the first, to our knowledge, deep sequencing study comparing the mutational spectra in a PTC and both LN and distant metastases. This study has yielded novel findings concerning intra-tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution and metastases dissemination in thyroid cancer.},

The emerging technology of single-cell RNA-seq gives access to gene expression mea-surements for thousands of cells, allowing dis-covery and characterization of cell types. How-ever, the data is confounded by technical vari-ation emanating from experimental errors and cell type-specific biases. Current approaches per-form a global normalization prior to analyzing biological signals, which does not resolve miss-ing data or variation dependent on latent cell types. Our model is formulated as a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model with cell-specific scal-ings that aid the iterative normalization and clus-tering of cells, teasing apart technical variation from biological signals. We demonstrate that this approach is superior to global normalization followed by clustering. We show identifiability and weak convergence guarantees of our method and present a scalable Gibbs inference algorithm. This method improves cluster inference in both synthetic and real single-cell data compared with previous methods, and allows easy interpretation and recovery of the underlying structure and cell types.},

This digital PLA method has femtomolar sensitivity, which enables the quantification of very small protein concentration changes over its entire 3-log dynamic range, a quality necessary for accounting for single-cell heterogeneity. We counted both endogenous (CD147) and exogenously expressed (GFP-p65) proteins from hundreds of single cells and determined the correlation between CD147 mRNA and the protein it encodes. Using our data, a stochastic two-state model of the central dogma was constructed and verified using joint mRNA/protein distributions, allowing us to estimate transcription burst sizes and extrinsic noise strength and calculate the transcription and translation rate constants in single mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Therapies that target signalling molecules that are mutated in cancers can often have substantial short-term effects, but the emergence of resistant cancer cells is a major barrier to full cures. Resistance can result from secondary mutations, but in other cases there is no clear genetic cause, raising the possibility of non-genetic rare cell variability. Here we show that human melanoma cells can display profound transcriptional variability at the single-cell level that predicts which cells will ultimately resist drug treatment. This variability involves infrequent, semi-coordinated transcription of a number of resistance markers at high levels in a very small percentage of cells. The addition of drug then induces epigenetic reprogramming in these cells, converting the transient transcriptional state to a stably resistant state. This reprogramming begins with a loss of SOX10-mediated differentiation followed by activation of new signalling pathways, partially mediated by the activity of the transcription factors JUN and/or AP-1 and TEAD. Our work reveals the multistage nature of the acquisition of drug resistance and provides a framework for understanding resistance dynamics in single cells. We find that other cell types also exhibit sporadic expression of many of these same marker genes, suggesting the existence of a general program in which expression is displayed in rare subpopulations of cells.},

abstract = {The large variability in mRNA and protein levels found from both static and dynamic measurements in single cells has been largely attributed to random periods of transcription, often occurring in bursts. The cell cycle has a pronounced global role in affecting transcriptional and translational output, but how this influences transcriptional statistics from noisy promoters is unknown and generally ignored by current stochastic models. Here we show that variable transcription from the synthetic tetO promoter in S. cerevisiae is dominated by its dependence on the cell cycle. Real-time measurements of fluorescent protein at high expression levels indicate tetO promoters increase transcription rate ∼2-fold in S/G2/M similar to constitutive genes. At low expression levels, where tetO promoters are thought to generate infrequent bursts of transcription, we observe random pulses of expression restricted to S/G2/M, which are correlated between homologous promoters present in the same cell. The analysis of static, single-cell mRNA measurements at different points along the cell cycle corroborates these findings. Our results demonstrate that highly variable mRNA distributions in yeast are not solely the result of randomly switching between periods of active and inactive gene expression, but instead largely driven by differences in transcriptional activity between G1 and S/G2/M.},

abstract = {A highly reproducible and sensitive single-cell RNA-Seq method will facilitate the understanding of the biological roles and underlying mechanisms of the non-genetic cellular heterogeneity. In this study, we report a novel single-cell RNA-Seq method called Quartz-Seq that has a simpler protocol and higher reproducibility and sensitivity compared to previously developed methods. We demonstrate that single-cell Quartz-Seq quantitatively detects various kind of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity. The method detects different cell types and different cell-cycle phases of a single-cell type. Moreover, this method can comprehensively reveal gene expression heterogeneity between single-cells of the same cell type at the same cell-cycle phase.},

abstract = {Gene expression noise is not only the mere consequence of stochasticity, but also a signal that reflects the upstream physical dynamics of the cognate molecular machinery. Soil bacteria facing recalcitrant pollutants exploit noise of catabolic promoters to deploy beneficial phenotypes such as metabolic bet-hedging and/or division of biochemical labor. Although the role of upstream promoter–regulator interplay in the origin of this noise is little understood, its specifications are probably ciphered in flow cytometry data patterns. We studied Pm promoter activity of the environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida and its cognate regulator XylS by following expression of Pm-gfp fusions in single cells. Using mathematical modeling and computational simulations, we determined the kinetic properties of the system and used them as a baseline code to interpret promoter activity in terms of upstream regulator dynamics. Transcriptional noise was predicted to depend on the intracellular physical distance between reg...},

abstract = {The regulation of cellular protein levels is a complex process involving many regulatory mechanisms, each introducing stochastic events, leading to variability of protein levels between isogenic cells. Previous studies have shown that perturbing genes involved in transcription regulation affects the amount of cell-to-cell variability in protein levels, but to date there has been no systematic characterization of variability in expression as a phenotype. In this research, we use single-cell expression levels of two fluorescent reporters driven by two different promoters under a wide range of genetic perturbations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to identify proteins that affect variability in the expression of these reporters. We introduce computational methodology to determine the variability caused by each perturbation and distinguish between global variability, which affects both reporters in a coordinated manner (e.g., due to cell size variability), and local variability, which affects the individual reporters independently (e.g., due to stochastic events in transcription initiation). Classifying genes by their variability phenotype (the effect of their deletion on reporter variability) identifies functionally coherent groups, which broadly correlate with the different stages of transcriptional regulation. Specifically, we find that most processes whose perturbation affects global variability are related to protein synthesis, protein transport, and cell morphology, whereas most processes whose perturbations affect local variability are related to DNA maintenance, chromatin regulation, and RNA synthesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the variability phenotypes of different protein complexes provide insights into their cellular functions. Our results establish the utility of variability phenotype for dissecting the regulatory mechanisms involved in gene expression.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Gene inactivation often has little or no apparent consequence for the phenotype of an organism. This property{\^{a}}€”enetic (or mutational) robustness{\^{a}}€”is pervasive, and has important implications for disease and evolution, but is not well understood. Dating back to at least Waddington, it has been suggested that mutational robustness may be related to the requirement to withstand environmental or stochastic perturbations. Here I show that global quantitative data from yeast are largely consistent with this idea. Considering the effects of mutations in all nonessential genes shows that genes that confer robustness to environmental or stochastic change also buffer the effects of genetic change, and with similar efficacy. This means that selection during evolution for environmental or stochastic robustness (also referred to as canalization) may frequently have the side effect of increasing genetic robustness. A dynamic environment may therefore promote the evolution of phenotypic complexity. It also means that {\^{a}}€{\oe}hub{\^{a}}€  genes in genetic interaction (synthetic lethal) networks are generally genes that confer environmental resilience and phenotypic stability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Balhorn2007,
abstract = {The protamines are a diverse family of small arginine-rich proteins that are synthesized in the late-stage spermatids of many animals and plants and bind to DNA, condensing the spermatid genome into a genetically inactive state. Vertebrates have from one to 15 protamine genes per haploid genome, which are clustered together on the same chromosome. Comparison of protamine gene and amino-acid sequences suggests that the family evolved from specialized histones through protamine-like proteins to the true protamines. Structural elements present in all true protamines are a series of arginine-rich DNA-anchoring domains (often containing a mixture of arginine and lysine residues in non-mammalian protamines) and multiple phosphorylation sites. The two protamines found in mammals, P1 and P2, are the most widely studied. P1 packages sperm DNA in all mammals, whereas protamine P2 is present only in the sperm of primates, many rodents and a subset of other placental mammals. P2, but not P1, is synthesized as a precursor that undergoes proteolytic processing after binding to DNA and also binds a zinc atom, the function of which is not known. P1 and P2 are phosphorylated soon after their synthesis, but after binding to DNA most of the phosphate groups are removed and cysteine residues are oxidized, forming disulfide bridges that link the protamines together. Both P1 and P2 have been shown to be required for normal sperm function in primates and many rodents.},

Such stochastic cell fate decisions generate nongenetic cellular diversity, which may be critical for metazoan development as well as optimized microbial resource utilization and survival in a fluctuating, frequently stressful environment. Here, we review several examples of cellular decision making from viruses, bacteria, yeast, lower metazoans, and mammals, highlighting the role of regulatory network structure and molecular noise.

abstract = {Enhancers are short sections of DNA that, when bound by specific proteins, regulate the level of transcription of a target gene. Len Pennacchio and colleagues examine the impact of enhancer redundancy on gene regulation in mouse limb development by deleting one or a combination of ten highly conserved enhancers located near seven genes that are required for limb development. While none of the ten individual enhancer deletions resulted in noticeable changes in limb morphology, the deletion of pairs of enhancers near the same genes resulted in altered limb development phenotypes. Analysing mouse ENCODE data, the authors find that enhancers near the same developmentally expressed gene commonly show similar activity patterns in the same tissue. They provide a statistical framework for estimating the number of enhancers that regulate each gene during development.},

abstract = {Thymus development is critical to the adaptive immune system, yet a comprehensive transcriptional framework capturing thymus organogenesis at single-cell resolution is still needed. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to capture 8 days of thymus development, perturbations of T cell receptor rearrangement, and in vitro organ cultures, producing profiles of 24,279 cells. We resolved transcriptional heterogeneity of developing lymphocytes, and genetic perturbation confirmed T cell identity of conventional and non-conventional lymphocytes. We characterized maturation dynamics of thymic epithelial cells in vivo, classified cell maturation state in a thymic organ culture, and revealed the intrinsic capacity of thymic epithelium to preserve transcriptional regularity despite exposure to exogenous retinoic acid. Finally, by integrating the cell atlas with human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and autoimmune-disease-related genes, we implicated embryonic thymus-resident cells as possible participants in autoimmune disease etiologies. This resource provides a single-cell transcriptional framework for biological discovery and molecular analysis of thymus organogenesis. Studies of thymus development typically lack single-cell resolution, use indirect readouts, or target narrow cell subsets. Using single-cell RNA sequencing during thymus organogenesis, Kernfeld and Genga et al. reveal cellular heterogeneity, interrogate developmental dynamics by direct observation, and pinpoint cell-specific expression patterns in stromal and blood populations.},

Here we demonstrate a simple but general strategy to drastically increase the capacity for multiplex detection of molecules in single cells by using optical super-resolution microscopy (SRM) and combinatorial labeling. As a proof of principle, we labeled mRNAs with unique combinations of fluorophores using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and resolved the sequences and combinations of fluorophores with SRM. We measured mRNA levels of 32 genes simultaneously in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.

We describe how such bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis in mammalian cells. To monitor transcription at high temporal resolution, we established various gene trap cell lines and transgenic cell lines expressing a short-lived luciferase protein from an unstable mRNA, and recorded bioluminescence in real time in single cells. Mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on- and off-switching rates in transcriptional activity and mean numbers of mRNAs produced during the bursts. Transcriptional kinetics were markedly altered by cis-regulatory DNA elements. Our analysis demonstrated that bursting kinetics are highly gene-specific, reflecting refractory periods during which genes stay inactive for a certain time before switching on again.},

Moreover, IL-2 is essential for the development and maintenance of T regulatory cells and for activation-induced cell death, thereby mediating tolerance and limiting inappropriate immune reactions. In this review, we focus on the molecular mechanisms and complex cellular actions of IL-2, its cooperative and opposing effects with other cytokines, and how both promoting and blocking the actions of IL-2 are being utilized in clinical medicine. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the downstream component of a protein kinase cascade that acts as an intracellular energy sensor maintaining the energy balance within the cell. The finding that leptin and adiponectin activate AMPK to alter metabolic pathways in muscle and liver provides direct evidence for this role in peripheral tissues. The hypothalamus is a key regulator of food intake and energy balance, coordinating body adiposity and nutritional state in response to peripheral hormones, such as leptin, peptide YY-(3–36), and ghrelin. To date the hormonal regulation of AMPK in the hypothalamus, or its potential role in the control of food intake, have not been reported. Here we demonstrate that counter-regulatory hormones involved in appetite control regulate AMPK activity and that pharmacological activation of AMPK in the hypothalamus increases food intake. In vivo administration of leptin, which leads to a reduction in food intake, decreases hypothalamic AMPK activity. By contrast, injection of ghrelin in vivo, which increases food intake, stimulates AMPK activity in the hypothalamus. Consistent with the effect of ghrelin, injection of 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide riboside, a pharmacological activator of AMPK, into either the third cerebral ventricle or directly into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus significantly increased food intake. These results suggest that AMPK is regulated in the hypothalamus by hormones which regulate food intake. Furthermore, direct pharmacological activation of AMPK in the hypothalamus is sufficient to increase food intake. These findings demonstrate that AMPK plays a role in the regulation of feeding and identify AMPK as a novel target for anti-obesity drugs.},

Computational techniques have arisen from areas such as single-cell 'omics and in cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically assume homogenous genetic and environmental backgrounds, which becomes particularly limiting as datasets grow in size and complexity. As a solution to this we describe a novel statistical framework that learns pseudotime trajectories in the presence of non-homogeneous genetic, phenotypic, or environmental backgrounds. We demonstrate that this enables us to identify interactions between such factors and the underlying genomic trajectory. By applying this model to both single-cell gene expression data and population level cancer studies we show that it uncovers known and novel interaction effects between genetic and enironmental factors and the expression of genes in pathways.

abstract = {Immune responses demonstrate a high level of intra-species variation, compensating for the specialization capacity of pathogens. The recent advent of in-depth immune phenotyping projects in large-scale cohorts has allowed a first look into the factors that shape the inter-individual diversity of the human immune system. Genetic approaches have identified genetic diversity as drivers of 20–40{\%} of the variation between the immune systems of individuals. The remaining 60–80{\%} is shaped by intrinsic factors, with age being the predominant factor, as well as by environmental influences, where cohabitation and chronic viral infections were identified as key mediators. We review and integrate the recent in-depth large-scale studies on human immune diversity and its potential impact on health. Video Abstract [Figure presented]},

abstract = {Genetic variation segregating within a species reflects the combined activities of mutation, selection, and genetic drift. In the absence of selection, polymorphisms are expected to be a random subset of new mutations; thus, comparing the effects of polymorphisms and new mutations provides a test for selection1–4.When evidence of selection exists, such comparisons can identify properties of mutations that are most likely to persist in natural populations2 . Here we investigate how mutation and selection have shaped variationin a cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression by empirically determining the effects of polymorphisms segregating in theTDH3 promoter among 85 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and comparing their effects to a distribution of mutational effects defined by 236 point mutations in the same promoter. Surprisingly, we find that selection on expression noise (that is, variability in expression among genetically identical cells5 ) appears to have had a greaterimpact on sequence variation in theTDH3 promoter than selection on mean expression level. This is not necessarily because variation in expression noise impacts fitness more than variationinmean expression level, but rather because of differences in the distributions of mutational effects for these two phenotypes. This study shows how systematically examining the effects of new mutations can enrich our understanding of evolutionary mechanisms. It also provides rare empirical evidence of selection acting on expression noise.},

abstract = {During mammalian meiotic prophase I, surveillance mechanisms exist to ensure that germ cells with defective synapsis or recombination are eliminated, thereby preventing the generation of aneuploid gametes and embryos. Meiosis in females is more error-prone than in males, and this is in part because the prophase I surveillance mechanisms are less efficient in females. A mechanistic understanding of this sexual dimorphism is currently lacking. In both sexes, asynapsed chromosomes are transcriptionally inactivated by ATR-dependent phosphorylation of histone H2AFX. This process, termed meiotic silencing, has been proposed to perform an important prophase I surveillance role. While the transcriptional effects of meiotic silencing at individual genes are well described in the male germ line, analogous studies in the female germ line have not been performed. Here we apply single- and multigene RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) to oocytes from chromosomally abnormal mouse models to uncover potential sex differences in the silencing response. Notably, we find that meiotic silencing in females is less efficient than in males. Within individual oocytes, genes located on the same asynapsed chromosome are silenced to differing extents, thereby generating mosaicism in gene expression profiles across oocyte populations. Analysis of sex-reversed XY female mice reveals that the sexual dimorphism in silencing is determined by gonadal sex rather than sex chromosome constitution. We propose that sex differences in meiotic silencing impact on the sexually dimorphic prophase I response to asynapsis.},

abstract = {Mammalian interphase chromosomes interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) through hundreds of large lamina-associated domains (LADs). We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of nearly 400 maps reveals a core architecture consisting of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts tend to be cell-type specific and are more sensitive to changes in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential interactions as detected by Hi-C. Finally, the consistency of NL contacts is inversely linked to gene activity in single cells and correlates positively with the heterochromatic histone modification H3K9me3. These results highlight fundamental principles of single-cell chromatin organization.},

abstract = {Full understanding of regulated gene expression requires characterization of stochastic variation in the activity of individual promoters. To avoid cell-to-cell variability and variation between the activity of specific gene copies, Sep{\'{u}}lveda et al. investigated the behavior of the lysogeny maintenance promoter of phage lambda in individual Escherichia coli cells. They measured the concentration of transcription factor and the actual number of mRNAs produced, and used mathematical modeling to discern the stochastic activity of the regulated promoter. The promoter underwent switching between configurations that occurred more rapidly than the lifetime of mRNA molecules produced, and individual copies of the same gene functioned independently in the same cell. Such studies can reveal new aspects of systems that have been well studied by more conventional techniques.Science, this issue p. 1218In vivo mapping of transcription-factor binding to the transcriptional output of the regulated gene is hindered by probabilistic promoter occupancy, the presence of multiple gene copies, and cell-to-cell variability. We demonstrate how to overcome these obstacles in the lysogeny maintenance promoter of bacteriophage lambda, PRM. We simultaneously measured the concentration of the lambda repressor CI and the number of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) from PRM in individual Escherichia coli cells, and used a theoretical model to identify the stochastic activity corresponding to different CI binding configurations. We found that switching between promoter configurations is faster than mRNA lifetime and that individual gene copies within the same cell act independently. The simultaneous quantification of transcription factor and promoter activity, followed by stochastic theoretical analysis, provides a tool that can be applied to other genetic circuits.},

abstract = {Inflammation occurs as a result of exposure of tissues and organs to harmful stimuli such as microbial pathogens, irritants, or toxic cellular components. The primary physical manifestations of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function to the affected area. These processes involve the major cells of the immune system, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, T-cells, and B-cells. However, examination of a range of inflammatory lesions demonstrates the presence of specific leukocytes in any given lesion. That is, the inflammatory process is regulated in such a way as to ensure that the appropriate leukocytes are recruited. These events are in turn controlled by a host of extracellular molecular regulators, including members of the cytokine and chemokine families that mediate both immune cell recruitment and complex intracellular signalling control mechanisms that characterise inflammation. This review will focus on the role of the main cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors in the pathophysiology of auto-inflammatory disorders, pro-inflammatory disorders, and neurological disorders involving inflammation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Additionally, the efficacy of vaccines is frequently decreased in elderly persons. Increased susceptibility to infections and reduced protection after vaccination reflect the impact of age-related changes on the immune system. The immune system undergoes a wide range of changes with increasing age. The aim of this review is to summarize cellular and molecular aspects of aging CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells play an essential role in mediating both humoral and cellular immune responses. Therefore, age-associated dysfunctions within CD4+ T cells have a strong clinical impact. Improving our understanding of the aged CD4+ T cells, in particular but also of the aged immune system in general, is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment programs which will facilitate healthy aging and improve the quality of life of the elderly population. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Here we studied the quantitative behaviour and cell-to-cell variability of a prototypical eukaryotic cell-fate decision system, the mating pheromone response pathway in yeast. We dissected and measured sources of variation in system output, analysing thousands of individual, genetically identical cells. Only a small proportion of total cell-to-cell variation is caused by random fluctuations in gene transcription and translation during the response ('expression noise'). Instead, variation is dominated by differences in the capacity of individual cells to transmit signals through the pathway ('pathway capacity') and to express proteins from genes ('expression capacity'). Cells with high expression capacity express proteins at a higher rate and increase in volume more rapidly. Our results identify two mechanisms that regulate cell-to-cell variation in pathway capacity. First, the MAP kinase Fus3 suppresses variation at high pheromone levels, while the MAP kinase Kss1 enhances variation at low pheromone levels. Second, pathway capacity and expression capacity are negatively correlated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism that allows cells to respond more precisely to pheromone in the presence of a large variation in expression capacity.},

abstract = {Nanog is a divergent homeodomain protein found in mammalian pluripotent cells and developing germ cells. Deletion of Nanog causes early embryonic lethality, whereas constitutive expression enables autonomous self-renewal of embryonic stem cells. Nanog is accordingly considered a core element of the pluripotent transcriptional network. However, here we report that Nanog fluctuates in mouse embryonic stem cells. Transient downregulation of Nanog appears to predispose cells towards differentiation but does not mark commitment. By genetic deletion we show that, although they are prone to differentiate, embryonic stem cells can self-renew indefinitely in the permanent absence of Nanog. Expanded Nanog null cells colonize embryonic germ layers and exhibit multilineage differentiation both in fetal and adult chimaeras. Although they are also recruited to the germ line, primordial germ cells lacking Nanog fail to mature on reaching the genital ridge. This defect is rescued by repair of the mutant allele. Thus Nanog is dispensible for expression of somatic pluripotency but is specifically required for formation of germ cells. Nanog therefore acts primarily in construction of inner cell mass and germ cell states rather than in the housekeeping machinery of pluripotency. We surmise that Nanog stabilizes embryonic stem cells in culture by resisting or reversing alternative gene expression states.},

Wishbone uses multi-dimensional single-cell data, such as mass cytometry or RNA-Seq data, as input and orders cells according to their developmental progression, and it pinpoints bifurcation points by labeling each cell as pre-bifurcation or as one of two post-bifurcation cell fates. Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages. A comparison of Wishbone to diffusion maps, SCUBA and Monocle shows that it outperforms these methods both in the accuracy of ordering cells and in the correct identification of branch points.},

abstract = {The distribution of genes on eukaryotic chromosomes is nonrandom, but the reasons behind this are not well understood. The commonly observed clustering of essential genes is a case in point. Here we model and test a new hypothesis. Essential proteins are unusual in that random fluctuations in abundance (noise) can be highly deleterious. We hypothesize that persistently open chromatin domains are sinks for essential genes, as they enable reduced noise by avoidance of transcriptional bursting associated with chromatin remodeling. Simulation of the model captures clustering and correctly predicts that (i) essential gene clusters are associated with low nucleosome occupancy (ii) noise-sensitive nonessential genes cluster with essential genes (iii) nonessential genes of similar knockout fitness are physically linked (iv) genes in domains rich in essential genes have low noise (v) essential genes are rare subtelomerically and (vi) essential gene clusters are preferentially conserved. We conclude that different noise characteristics of different genomic domains favors nonrandom gene positioning. This has implications for gene therapy and understanding transgenic phenotypes.},

However, few analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical challenges of single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reactions data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS:We present a statistical framework for the exploration, quality control and analysis of single-cell gene expression data from microfluidic arrays. We assess accuracy and within-sample heterogeneity of single-cell expression and develop quality control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements.

Based on this model, we derive a combined likelihood ratio test for differential expression that incorporates both the discrete and continuous components. Using an experiment that examines treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous component in isolation, or a t-test on the zero-inflated data.

abstract = {Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) are important histone modifiers, which silence gene expression, yet there exists a subset of PRC-bound genes actively transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). It is likely that the role of PRC is to dampen expression of these PRC-active genes. However, it is unclear how this flipping between chromatin states alters the kinetics of transcriptional burst size and frequency relative to genes with exclusively activating marks. To investigate this, we integrate histone modifications and RNAPII states derived from bulk ChIP-seq data with single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We find that PRC-active genes have a greater cell-to-cell variation in expression than active genes with the same mean expression levels, and validate these results by knockout experiments. We also show that PRC-active genes are clustered on chromosomes in both two and three dimensions, and interactions with active enhancers promote a stabilization of gene expression noise. These findings provide new insights into how chromatin regulation modulates stochastic gene expression and transcriptional bursting, with implications for regulation of pluripotency and development.},

@article{Bertaux2014,
abstract = {Isogenic cells sensing identical external signals can take markedly different decisions. Such decisions often correlate with pre-existing cell-to-cell differences in protein levels. When not neglected in signal transduction models, these differences are accounted for in a static manner, by assuming randomly distributed initial protein levels. However, this approach ignores the a priori non-trivial interplay between signal transduction and the source of this cell-to-cell variability: temporal fluctuations of protein levels in individual cells, driven by noisy synthesis and degradation. Thus, modeling protein fluctuations, rather than their consequences on the initial population heterogeneity, would set the quantitative analysis of signal transduction on firmer grounds. Adopting this dynamical view on cell-to-cell differences amounts to recast extrinsic variability into intrinsic noise. Here, we propose a generic approach to merge, in a systematic and principled manner, signal transduction models with stochastic protein turnover models. When applied to an established kinetic model of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, our approach markedly increased model prediction capabilities. One obtains a mechanistic explanation of yet-unexplained observations on fractional killing and non-trivial robust predictions of the temporal evolution of cell resistance to TRAIL in HeLa cells. Our results provide an alternative explanation to survival via induction of survival pathways since no TRAIL-induced regulations are needed and suggest that short-lived anti-apoptotic protein Mcl1 exhibit large and rare fluctuations. More generally, our results highlight the importance of accounting for stochastic protein turnover to quantitatively understand signal transduction over extended durations, and imply that fluctuations of short-lived proteins deserve particular attention.},

abstract = {T follicular helper cells are the main CD4(+) T cells specialized in supporting B-cell responses, but their role in driving transfusion-associated alloimmunization is not fully characterized. Reports of T follicular helper subsets displaying various markers and functional activities underscore the need for better characterization/identification of markers with defined functions. Here we show that a previously unidentified subset of human circulating T follicular helper cells expressing TIGIT, the T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory domains, exhibit strong B-cell help functions. Compared to the subset lacking the receptor, T follicular helper cells expressing this receptor up-regulated co-stimulatory molecules and produced higher levels of interleukins (IL-21 and IL-4) critical for promoting B-cell activation/differentiation. Furthermore, this subset was more efficient at inducing the differentiation of B cells into plasmablasts and promoting immunoglobulin G production. Blocking antibodies abrogated the B-cell help properties of receptor-expressing T follicular helper cells, consistent with the key role of this molecule in T follicular helper-associated responses. Importantly, in chronically transfused patients with sickle cell anemia, we identified functional differences of this subset between alloimmunized and non-alloimmunized patients. Altogether, these studies suggest that expression of the T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and immunoreceptor tyro-sine-based inhibitory domains not only represents a novel circulating T follicular helper biomarker, but is also functional and promotes strong B-cell help and ensuing immunoglobulin G production. These findings open the way to defining new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in modulating humoral responses in alloimmunization, and possibly vaccination, autoimmunity and immune deficiencies.},

We validate MAGIC on several biological systems and find it effective at recovering gene-gene relationships and additional structures. Applied to the epithilial to mesenchymal transition, MAGIC reveals a phenotypic continuum, with the majority of cells residing in intermediate states that display stem-like signatures, and infers known and previously uncharacterized regulatory interactions, demonstrating that our approach can successfully uncover regulatory relations without perturbations.

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them. Examples and especially the visualizations are principle features...As a source for the methods of statistical learning...it will probably be a long time before there is a competitor to this book."},

Transplantation studies showed that germ cells from mutant mice did not colonize recipient testes, suggesting that the defect is intrinsic to the stem cells. We determined that the luxoid mutant contains a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding Plzf, a transcriptional repressor that regulates the epigenetic state of undifferentiated cells, and showed that Plzf is coexpressed with Oct4 in undifferentiated spermatogonia.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Background: Advances in single cell genomics provide a way of routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression analysis is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies. Results: We have developed a novel agglomerative clustering method thatwe call pcaReduce to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cell states. Using two real single cell datasets, we compared our approach to other commonly used statistical techniques, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering. We found that pcaReduce was able to give more consistent clustering structures when compared to broad and detailed cell type labels. Conclusions: Our novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering establishes a connection between the representation of the expression data and the number of cell types that can be discovered. In doing so we found that pcaReduce performs better than either technique in isolation in terms of characterising putative cell states. Our methodology is complimentary to other single cell clustering techniques and adds to a growing palette of single cell bioinformatics tools for profiling heterogeneous cell populations.

abstract = {Molecular noise in gene expression can generate substantial variability in protein concentration. However, its effect on the precision of a natural eukaryotic circuit such as the control of cell cycle remains unclear. We use single-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled budding yeast to measure times from division to budding (G1) and from budding to the next division. The variability in G1 decreases with the square root of the ploidy through a 1N/2N/4N ploidy series, consistent with simple stochastic models for molecular noise. Also, increasing the gene dosage of G1 cyclins decreases the variability in G1. A new single-cell reporter for cell protein content allows us to determine the contribution to temporal G1 variability of deterministic size control (that is, smaller cells extending G1). Cell size control contributes significantly to G1 variability in daughter cells but not in mother cells. However, even in daughters, size-independent noise is the largest quantitative contributor to G1 variability. Exit of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 from the nucleus partitions G1 into two temporally uncorrelated and functionally distinct steps. The first step, which depends on the G1 cyclin gene CLN3, corresponds to noisy size control that extends G1 in small daughters, but is of negligible duration in mothers. The second step, whose variability decreases with increasing CLN2 gene dosage, is similar in mothers and daughters. This analysis decomposes the regulatory dynamics of the Start transition into two independent modules, a size sensing module and a timing module, each of which is predominantly controlled by a different G1 cyclin.},

abstract = {Cross-sectional time series single cell data confound several sources of variation, with contributions from measurement noise, stochastic cell to cell variation and cell progression at different rates. Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq data sets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis data set, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of cross-sectional time series.},

abstract = {The immune system of vertebrate species consists of many different cell types that have distinct functional roles and are subject to different evolutionary pressures. Here, we first analysed gene conservation of all major immune cell types in human and mouse. Our results revealed higher gene turnover and faster evolution of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared to other immune cell populations, and especially T cells, but similar conservation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein coding genes. To validate these findings in a distant vertebrate species, we used single-cell RNA-Sequencing of lck:GFP cells in zebrafish to obtain the first transcriptome of specific immune cell types in a non-mammalian species. Unsupervised clustering and single-cell TCR locus reconstruction identified three cell populations, T-cells, a novel type of NK-like cells and a smaller population of myeloid-like cells. Differential expression analysis uncovered new immune cell specific genes, including novel immunoglobulin-like receptors, and neofunctionalization of recently duplicated paralogs. Evolutionary analyses confirmed a higher gene turnover and lower conservation of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared to T cells in fish species, suggesting that this is a general property of immune cell types across all vertebrates.},

Furthermore, mRNAs of ACT (activator of CREM in testis) and CREM target genes are downregulated in miwinulltestes. Whereas MIWI and CREM do not regulate each other's expression, MIWI complexes with mRNAs of ACT and CREM target genes. Hence, MIWI may control spermiogenesis by regulating the stability of these mRNAs.},

Although the number of RTEs decreases after reaching a peak at 6 weeks of age, thymic output as a function of thymic size is surprisingly age-independent. The CD4:CD8 ratio of RTEs declines with age, partly because of a striking decrease in steady-state proliferation of CD4+ RTEs in older mice. RTEs in aged mice undergo phenotypic maturation in the lymphoid periphery with delayed kinetics compared with young mice. RTEs from aged mice secrete less IL-2, proliferate less well, and achieve only weak expression of early-activation markers compared with more mature na{\"{i}}ve peripheral T cells from the same mice. The proportion of GFP- cells in the CD4+ and CD8+ thymic compartments increases with age, partly as a result of leakiness in the aged thymus, allowing reentry of na{\"{i}}ve peripheral T cells.},

abstract = {Global transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of T cells have been rich sources of unbiased data for understanding T-cell activation. Lack of full concordance of these datasets has illustrated that important facets of T-cell activation are controlled at the level of translation. We undertook translatome analysis of CD8 T-cell activation, combining polysome profiling and microarray analysis. We revealed that altering T-cell receptor stimulation influenced recruitment of mRNAs to heavy polysomes and translation of subsets of genes. A major pathway that was compromised, when TCR signaling was suboptimal, was linked to ribosome biogenesis, a rate-limiting factor in both cell growth and proliferation. Defective TCR signaling affected transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA precursors, as well as the translation of specific ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Mechanistically, IL-2 production was compromised in weakly stimulated T cells, affecting the abundance of Myc protein, a known regulator of ribosome biogenesis. Consequently, weakly activated T cells showed impaired production of ribosomes and a failure to maintain proliferative capacity after stimulation. We demonstrate that primary T cells respond to various environmental cues by regulating ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation at multiple levels to sustain proliferation and differentiation.},

These data show that cells undergo an intermediate state of co-expression of lineage-specific genes, followed by a concurrent establishment of the trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages achieve dosage compensation of X chromosome RNA levels prior to implantation. However, in contrast to the mouse, XIST is transcribed from both alleles throughout the progression of this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds. We envision broad utility of this transcriptional atlas in future studies on human development as well as in stem cell research.},

abstract = {In mammals, a key transition in spermatogenesis is the exit from spermatogonial differentiation and mitotic proliferation and the entry into spermatocyte differentiation and meiosis. Although several genes that regulate this transition have been identified, how it is controlled and coordinated remains poorly understood. Here, we examine the role in male gametogenesis of the Doublesex-related gene Dmrt6 (Dmrtb1) in mice and find that Dmrt6 plays a crucial role in directing germ cells through the mitotic-to-meiotic germ cell transition. DMRT6 protein is expressed in late mitotic spermatogonia. In mice of the C57BL/6J strain, a null mutation in Dmrt6 disrupts spermatogonial differentiation, causing inappropriate expression of spermatogonial differentiation factors, including SOHLH1, SOHLH2 and DMRT1 as well as the meiotic initiation factor STRA8, and causing most late spermatogonia to undergo apoptosis. In mice of the 129Sv background, most Dmrt6 mutant germ cells can complete spermatogonial differentiation and enter meiosis, but they show defects in meiotic chromosome pairing, establishment of the XY body and processing of recombination foci, and they mainly arrest in mid-pachynema. mRNA profiling of Dmrt6 mutant testes together with DMRT6 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing suggest that DMRT6 represses genes involved in spermatogonial differentiation and activates genes required for meiotic prophase. Our results indicate that Dmrt6 plays a key role in coordinating the transition in gametogenic programs from spermatogonial differentiation and mitosis to spermatocyte development and meiosis.},

Using simulations, we demonstrate that our method has greater power than existing approaches for detecting cell libraries with low UMI counts, while controlling the false discovery rate among detected cells.

abstract = {A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.},

abstract = {Nanos gene encodes for zinc-finger protein with putative RNA-binding activity which shows an evolutionary conserved function in germ cell development. In the mouse, three Nanos homologs have been identified: Nanos1, Nanos2 and Nanos3. The Nanos3 ortholog is expressed in both male and female gonads of early embryo and, after birth, it is found only in the testis. Nanos3 targeted disruption results in the complete loss of germ cells in both sexes; however the role of Nanos3 in the testis during the postnatal period has not been explored yet. In this study, we show that, in prepuberal testis, Nanos3 is expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia and that its up-regulation causes accumulation of cells in the G1 phase, indicating that this protein is able to delay the cell cycle progression of spermatogonial cells. This is in line with the observation that the cell cycle length of the undifferentiated germ cells is longer than in differentiating spermatogonia. We also demonstrate a conserved mechanism of action of Nanos3, involving the interaction with the murine RNA-binding protein Pumilio2 and consisting of a potential translational repressor activity. According to the possible role of Nanos3 in inhibiting spermatogonia cell differentiation, we show that treatment with the differentiating factor all-trans retinoic acid induces a dramatic down-regulation of its expression.

abstract = {A more complete understanding of the causes and effects of cell-cell variability in gene expression is needed to elucidate whether the resulting phenotypes are disadvantageous or confer some adaptive advantage. Here we show that increased variability in gene expression, affected by the sequence of the TATA box, can be beneficial after an acute change in environmental conditions. We rationally introduce mutations within the TATA region of an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL1 promoter and measure promoter responses that can be characterized as being either highly variable and rapid or steady and slow. We computationally illustrate how a stable transcription scaffold can result in "bursts" of gene expression, enabling rapid individual cell responses in the transient and increased cell-cell variability at steady state. We experimentally verify computational predictions that the rapid response and increased cell-cell variability enabled by TATA-containing promoters confer a clear benefit in the face of an acute environmental stress. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In T cells, the stochasticity of protein expression could contribute to the useful diversification of biological functions within a clonal population or interfere with accurate antigen discrimination. Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, we examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T cell activation. We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity. These findings reveal how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled manner.},

abstract = {Using single-cell -omics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased study of cellular dynamic processes. Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a compre-hensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred order-ing, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, TSCAN and Monocle DDRTree, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajec-tory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively eval-uated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers. These discussions can be held at github.com/dynverse/dynverse/issues.},

We used live-cell imaging to investigate the role of p53 dynamics in fractional killing of colon cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that both surviving and dying cells reach similar levels of p53, indicating that cell death is not determined by a fixed p53 threshold. Instead, a cell's probability of death depends on the time and levels of p53. Cells must reach a threshold level of p53 to execute apoptosis, and this threshold increases with time. The increase in p53 apoptotic threshold is due to drug-dependent induction of anti-apoptotic genes, predominantly in the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. Our study underlines the importance of measuring the dynamics of key players in response to chemotherapy to determine mechanisms of resistance and optimize the timing of combination therapy.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity of microbial cells has attracted much attention and several research efforts have been dedicated to the description of methods aiming at characterizing phenotypic heterogeneity and its impact on microbial populations. However, different approaches have also been suggested in order to take benefit from noise in a bioprocess perspective, e.g. by increasing the robustness or productivity of a microbial population. This review is dedicated to outline these controlling methods. A common issue, that has still to be addressed, is the experimental identification and the mathematical expression of noise. Indeed, the effective interfacing of microbial physiology with external parameters that can be used for controlling physiology depends on the acquisition of reliable signals. Latest technologies, like single cell microfluidics and advanced flow cytometric approaches, enable linking physiology, noise, heterogeneity in productive microbes with environmental cues and hence allow correctly mapping and predicting biological behavior via mathematical representations. However, like in the field of electronics, signals are perpetually subjected to noise. If appropriately interpreted, this noise can give an additional insight into the behavior of the individual cells within a microbial population of interest. This review focuses on recent progress made at describing, treating and exploiting biological noise in the context of microbial populations used in various bioprocess applications.},

Our single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data on over 2,500 cells from the mouse testis improves upon stage marker detection and validation, capturing the continuity of differentiation rather than artificially chosen stages. scRNA-seq also enables the analysis of rare cell populations masked in bulk sequencing data and reveals new insights into the regulation of sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis.

abstract = {Tissue stem cells produce a constant flux of differentiated cells with distinct proportions. Here, we show that stem cells in colonic crypts differentiate early to form precisely 1:3 ratio of secretory to absorptive cells. This precision is surprising, as there are only eight stem cells making irreversible fate decisions, and so large stochastic effects of this small pool should have yielded much larger noise in cell proportions. We use single molecule FISH, lineage-tracing mice and simulations to identify the homeostatic mechanisms facilitating robust proportions. We find that Delta-Notch lateral inhibition operates in a restricted spatial zone to reduce initial noise in cell proportions. Increased dwell time and dispersive migration of secretory cells further averages additional variability added during progenitor divisions and breaks up continuous patches of same-fate cells. These noise-reducing mechanisms resolve the trade-off between early commitment and robust differentiation and ensure spatially uniform spread of secretory cells. Our findings may apply to other cases where small progenitor pools expand to give rise to precise tissue cell proportions.},

Since placodes are often considered unique to vertebrates, we have characterised an amphioxus COE/EBF gene with the aim of using it as a marker to examine the timing and location of peripheral neuron differentiation. A single COE/EBF family member, AmphiCoe, was isolated from the amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae. AmphiCoe lies basal to the vertebrate COE/EBF genes in molecular phylogenetic analysis, suggesting that the duplications that formed the vertebrate COE/EBF family were specific to the vertebrate lineage. AmphiCoe is expressed in the central nervous system and in a small number of scattered ectodermal cells on the flanks of neurulae stage embryos. These cells become at least largely recessed beneath the ectoderm. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine embryos in which the ectoderm had been partially peeled away. This revealed that these cells have neuronal morphology, and we infer that they are the precursors of epidermal primary sensory neurons. These characters lead us to suggest that differentiation of some ectodermal cells into sensory neurons with a tendency to sink beneath the embryonic surface represents a primitive feature that has become incorporated into placodes during vertebrate evolution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes in environmental conditions lead to expression variation that manifest at the level of gene regulatory networks. Despite a strong understanding of the role noise plays in synthetic biological systems, it remains unclear how propagation of expression heterogeneity in an endogenous regulatory network is distributed and utilized by cells transitioning through a key developmental event. RESULTS: Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of a single-cell transcriptional network of 45 transcription factors in THP-1 human myeloid monocytic leukemia cells undergoing differentiation to macrophages. We systematically measure temporal regulation of expression and variation by profiling 120 single cells at 8 distinct time points, and infer highly controlled regulatory modules through which signaling operates with stochastic effects. This reveals dynamic and specific rewiring as a cellular strategy for differentiation. The integration of both positive and negative co-expression networks further identifies the proto-oncogene MYB as a network hinge to modulate both the pro- and anti- differentiation pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to averaged cell populations, temporal single-cell expression profiling provides a much more powerful technique to probe for mechanistic insights underlying cellular differentiation. We believe that our approach will form the basis of novel strategies to study the regulation of transcription at a single-cell level.},

Spermatogonial terminology is confusing to many and spermatogonial kinetics is perceived as com- plex. The field is dominated by only a few individuals whose work is highly specialized and whose techniques are not generally used. Thus, there is a definite need to simplify this little understood topic for others. What follows is information about spermatogonia, in particular the terminology applied to spermatogonia and their function, a description of the kinetics and renewal of spermatogonia, the origin of spermatogonia, the regu- lation of spermatogonial numbers, and conditions that af- fect spermatogonia. A question-and-answer format is used in an attempt to simplify a complex area of research for an audience that is generally not familiar with the topic or that has in the past had difficulty with the topic. A variety of other reviews on the topic are embedded in the dialogue. Reviews are suggested for readers who have mastered the basics and wish to examine the details of spermatogonia and their properties. We limit our discus- sion of spermatogonia to mammalian systems and, unless otherwise specified, direct our comments primarily to ro- dent systems, from which most of our information about spermatogonia},

abstract = {High-throughput single-cell gene expression experiments can be used to uncover branching dynamics in cell populations undergoing differentiation through use of pseudotime methods. We develop the branching Gaussian process (BGP), a non-parametric model that is able to identify branching dynamics for individual genes and provides an estimate of branching times for each gene with an associated credible region. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic data and a published single-cell gene expression hematopoiesis study. The method requires prior information about pseudotime and global cellular branching for each cell but the probabilistic nature of the method means that it is robust to errors in these global branch labels and can be used to discover early branching genes which diverge before the inferred global cell branching. The code is open-source and available at https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/BranchedGP},

abstract = {Our understanding of the development and maintenance of tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constituent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves-all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

abstract = {In mammalian spermatozoa, most but not all of the genome is densely packaged by protamines. Here we reveal the molecular logic underlying the retention of nucleosomes in mouse spermatozoa, which contain only 1{\%} residual histones. We observe high enrichment throughout the genome of nucleosomes at CpG-rich sequences that lack DNA methylation. Residual nucleosomes are largely composed of the histone H3.3 variant and are trimethylated at Lys4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3). Canonical H3.1 and H3.2 histones are also enriched at CpG-rich promoters marked by Polycomb-mediated H3K27me3, a modification predictive of gene repression in preimplantation embryos. Histone variant-specific nucleosome retention in sperm is strongly associated with nucleosome turnover in round spermatids. Our data show evolutionary conservation of the basic principles of nucleosome retention in mouse and human sperm, supporting a model of epigenetic inheritance by nucleosomes between generations.},

abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations are inherent to gene expression and can drive cell-fate specification. We used such fluctuations to modulate reactivation of HIV from latency-a quiescent state that is a major barrier to an HIV cure. By screening a diverse library of bioactive small molecules, we identified more than 80 compounds that modulated HIV gene-expression fluctuations (i.e., "noise"), without changing mean expression. These noise-modulating compounds would be neglected in conventional screens, and yet, they synergized with conventional transcriptional activators. Noise enhancers reactivated latent cells significantly better than existing best-in-class reactivation drug combinations (and with reduced off-target cytotoxicity), whereas noise suppressors stabilized latency. Noise-modulating chemicals may provide novel probes for the physiological consequences of noise and an unexplored axis for drug discovery, allowing enhanced control over diverse cell-fate decisions.},

Aging led to increased transcriptional noise, indicating deregulated epigenetic control. We observed highly distinct effects of aging on cell type level, uncovering increased cholesterol biosynthesis in type-2 pneumocytes and lipofibroblasts as a novel hallmark of lung aging. Proteomic profiling revealed extracellular matrix remodeling in old mice, including increased collagen IV and XVI and decreased Fraser syndrome complex proteins and Collagen XIV. Computational integration of the aging proteome and single cell transcriptomes predicted the cellular source of regulated proteins and created a first unbiased reference of the aging lung.

abstract = {Mixture modeling provides an effective approach to the differential expression problem in microarray data analysis. Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike-in data, and in a cross-validation calculation.},

abstract = {A classic problem in population and evolutionary biology is to understand how a population optimizes its fitness in fluctuating environments. A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

abstract = {Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. This deterioration is the primary risk factor for major human pathologies, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Aging research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of aging is controlled, at least to some extent, by genetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. This Review enumerates nine tentative hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in different organisms, with special emphasis on mammalian aging. These hallmarks are: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate hallmarks and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying pharmaceutical targets to improve human health during aging, with minimal side effects. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

It enables coordination of gene expression across large regulons, as well as probabilistic differentiation strategies that function across cell populations. At the longest timescales, noise may facilitate evolutionary transitions.

Results: We have developed the R/Bioconductor package scater to facilitate rigorous pre-processing, quality control, normalization and visualization of scRNA-seq data. The package provides a conveni-ent, flexible workflow to process raw sequencing reads into a high-quality expression dataset ready for downstream analysis. scater provides a rich suite of plotting tools for single-cell data and a flex-ible data structure that is compatible with existing tools and can be used as infrastructure for future software development.

While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.},

abstract = {Isogenic cells in a common environment show substantial cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, often referred to as “expression noise.” Here, we use multiple single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets to identify features associated with high or low expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells. These include the core promoter architecture of a gene, with CpG island promoters and a TATA box associated with low and high noise, respectively. High noise is also associated with “conflicting” chromatin states—the absence of transcription-associated histone modifications or the presence of repressive ones in active genes. Genes regulated by pluripotency factors through super-enhancers show high and correlated expression variability, consistent with fluctuations in the pluripotent state. Together, our results provide an integrated view of how core promoters, chromatin, regulation, and pluripotency fluctuations contribute to the variability of gene expression across individual stem cells. An integrative computational analysis identifies regulatory features that are statistically associated with high and low gene expression noise in mouse embryonic stem cells.},

abstract = {With the rapidly increasing availability of high-throughput in situ hybridization images, how to effectively analyze these images at high resolution for global patterns and testable hypotheses has become an urgent challenge. Here we developed a semi-automated image analysis pipeline to analyze in situ hybridization images of E14.5 mouse embryos at single-cell res-olution for more than 1600 telencephalon-expressed genes from the Eurexpress database. Using this pipeline, we derived the spatial gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution across the cortical layers to gain insight into the key processes oc-curring during cerebral cortex development. These profiles displayed high spatial modularity in gene expression, precisely recapitulated known differentiation zones, and uncovered additional unknown transition zones or cellular states. In partic-ular, they revealed a distinctive spatial transition phase dedicated to chromatin remodeling events during neural differen-tiation, which can be validated by genomic clustering patterns, epigenetic modifications switches, and network modules. Our analysis further revealed a role of mitotic checkpoints during spatial gene expression state transition. As a novel ap-proach to analyzing at the single-cell level the spatial modularity, dynamic trajectory, and transient states of gene expression during embryonic neural differentiation and to inferring regulatory events, our approach will be useful and applicable in many different systems for understanding the dynamic differentiation processes in vivo and at high resolution. [Supplemental material is available for this article.] With worldwide initiatives towards image-based analysis of the transcriptome of the developing mouse embryo, and developing mouse and human brains, in situ RNA hybridization (ISH) images are being rapidly generated in a high-throughput manner using automated sample preparation and microscopy image acquisition. For example, the Eurexpress project has generated ISH images for more than 18,000 mRNAs and 400 miRNAs in mouse prenatal samples, many of which are from Theiler Stage 23 (or embryonic day 14.5 [E14.5]) (Diez-Roux et al. 2011). More recently, the Allen Institute for Brain Science has generated a large number of ISH images for mouse and human brains, including the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Lein et al. 2007), Allen Human Brain Atlas (Hawrylycz et al. 2012), BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain (Miller et al. 2014), and Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (Thompson et al. 2014). These resources provide detailed visualization of the spatial pattern of gene expression at the cellular level in vivo. However, currently these images can only be visually examined one at a time or automatically annotated at a coarse level (Diez-Roux et al. 2011; Thompson et al. 2014), limiting their broad usage by the research community. How to effectively analyze these image data at high spatial resolution for global patterns and testable hy-potheses has thus become an urgent challenge. Here we use the ce-rebral cortex development system as a model to develop a semi-automated image analysis pipeline.},

abstract = {In the XY pachytene spermatocyte, the sex chromosomes do not synapse except for the pseudoautosomal region and become transcriptionally silenced. It has been suggested that the meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC) also occurs in oocytes. In the XY sex-reversed female mouse, the sex chromosomes fail to pair in the majority of oocytes and a greater number of oocytes are eliminated during the meiotic prophase compared to the XX female. Yet, many XY oocytes survive to reach the second meiotic metaphase. The goal of our current study was to determine whether the single X chromosome shows the characteristics of asynapsis and meiotic silencing in a proportion of XY oocytes, which can explain the survival of the remaining oocytes. We first examined the accumulation of markers associated with asynapsis or transcriptional silencing, i.e., BRCA1, $\gamma$H2AX, H3K9me3, and H3K27me3, at the single X chromosome in the XY oocyte. We found that $\gamma$H2AX and BRCA1 were enriched on the single X chromosome whereas H3K9me3 was not, and H3K27me3 was enriched at all chromosomes in the majority of XY oocytes. We next examined the meiotic silencing of the single X chromosome using enrichment of the X-encoded ATRX protein. On average, ATRX enrichment was lower in XY oocytes than in XX oocytes as expected from its half gene dosage. However, the intensity of ATRX staining in XY oocytes harboring $\gamma$H2AX domains showed a remarkable heterogeneity. We conclude that MSUC occurs with varying consequences, resulting in a heterogeneous population of oocytes with respect to protein enrichment in the XY female mouse.},

abstract = {Haploid round spermatids undergo a remarkable transformation during spermiogenesis. The nucleus polarizes to one side of the cell as the nucleus condenses and elongates, and the microtubule-based manchette sculpts the nucleus into its species-specific head shape. The assembly of the central component of the sperm flagellum, known as the axoneme, begins early in spermiogenesis, and is followed by the assembly of secondary structures needed for normal flagella. The final remodelling of the mature elongated spermatid occurs during spermiation, when the spermatids line up along the luminal edge, shed their residual cytoplasm and are ultimately released into the lumen. Defects in spermiogenesis and spermiation are manifested as low sperm number, abnormal sperm morphology and poor motility and are commonly observed during reproductive toxicant administration, as well as in genetically modified mouse models of male infertility. This chapter summarizes the major physiological processes and the most commonly observed defects in spermiogenesis and spermiation, to aid in the diagnosis of the potential mechanisms that could be perturbed by experimental manipulation such as reproductive toxicant administration.},

Hence, we constrain our approach to only search for the clusterings that agree across the views. Our algorithm does not have any hyperpa- rameters to set, which is a major advantage in unsupervised learning.

abstract = {The External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) is an ad-hoc group with approximately 70 members from private, public, and academic organizations. The group is developing a set of external RNA control transcripts that can be used to assess technical performance in gene expression assays. The ERCC is now initiating the Testing Phase of the project, during which candidate external RNA controls will be evaluated in both microarray and QRT-PCR gene expression platforms. This document describes the proposed experiments and informatics process that will be followed to test and qualify individual controls. The ERCC is distributing this description of the proposed testing process in an effort to gain consensus and to encourage feedback from the scientific community. On October 4-5, 2005, the ERCC met to further review the document, clarify ambiguities, and plan next steps. A summary of this meeting and changes to the test plan are provided as an appendix to this manuscript.},

@article{Dottermusch-Heidel2014,
abstract = {In both mammalian and Drosophila spermatids, the completely histone-based chromatin structure is reorganized to a largely protamine-based structure. During this histone-to-protamine switch, transition proteins are expressed, for example TNP1 and TNP2 in mammals and Tpl94D in Drosophila. Recently, we demonstrated that in Drosophila spermatids, H3K79 methylation accompanies histone H4 hyperacetylation during chromatin reorganization. Preceding the histone-to-protamine transition, the H3K79 methyltransferase Grappa is expressed, and the predominant isoform bears a C-terminal extension. Here, we show that isoforms of the Grappa-equivalent protein in humans, rats and mice, that is DOT1L, have a C-terminal extension. In mice, the transcript of this isoform was enriched in the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis. In human and mice spermatids, di- and tri-methylated H3K79 temporally overlapped with hyperacetylated H4 and thus accompanied chromatin reorganization. In rat spermatids, trimethylated H3K79 directly preceded transition protein loading on chromatin. We analysed the impact of bacterial infections on spermatid chromatin using a uropathogenic Escherichia coli-elicited epididymo-orchitis rat model and showed that these infections caused aberrant spermatid chromatin. Bacterial infections led to premature emergence of trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated H4. Trimethylated H3K79 and hyperacetylated H4 simultaneously occurred with transition protein TNP1, which was never observed in spermatids of mock-infected rats. Upon bacterial infection, only histone-based spermatid chromatin showed abnormalities, whereas protamine-compacted chromatin seemed to be unaffected. Our results indicated that H3K79 methylation is a histone modification conserved in Drosophila, mouse, rat and human spermatids and may be a prerequisite for proper chromatin reorganization.},

@article{Love2014,
abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-Seq data, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data. DESeq2 uses shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of the estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression and facilitates downstream tasks such as gene ranking and visualization. DESeq2 is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},
