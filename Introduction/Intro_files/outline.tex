\section{Outline}

The overarching topic of this thesis is the quantification and interpretation of transcriptional noise as measured by scRNA-Seq. \textbf{Chapter 2} presents an initial experiment to study how  transcriptional noise effects the immune system. We see that transcriptional noise increases across multiple immune response genes during ageing which therefore could explain a disrupted immune response in older individuals. This finding has been published in the following paper:

Studying changes in variability between two conditions was restricted to genes that did not change in mean expression due to a strong confounding between variability and mean expression. In \textbf{Chapter 3}, I therefore extended the statistical framework from chapter 2 to correct for this confounding effect. This correction lead to (i) a stabilisation of model parameters, (ii) expansion of the gene set that can be tested for changes in variability and (iii) a novel way of interpreting transcriptional dynamics. This project has been published as:

The extended model offers the unique opportunity to study changes in variability across multiple cell types even when mean expression changes. In \textbf{Chapter 4}, I apply the newly developed model to test changes in variability over pseudotime. For this, droplet-based scRNA-Seq data of mouse spermatogenesis was used to dissect the transcriptional dynamics during this developmental process. Parts of the study are available online as:

\end{Abstract}

Finally, I will discuss current challenges in modelling transcriptional noise from scRNA-Seq data and experimental strategies to modulate expression variability.
