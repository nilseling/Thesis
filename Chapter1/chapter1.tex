\begin{Abstract}
Ageing is characterised by progressive loss of physiological and cellular functions, but the molecular basis of this decline remains largely unexplored. Here, we explored how ageing impacts transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA-sequencing of over a thousand unstimulated and stimulated naive and effector memory CD4$^+$ T cells from young and old mice. Furthermore, we sampled cells from two divergent strains of mice to assess the evolutionary conservation of the molecular ageing signature. In young animals, immunological activation drives a transcriptomic switch from variable to tightly regulated gene expression, characterised by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. The up-regulation of a set of immune response genes is conserved between the two mouse strains as is the decrease in expression variability upon immune activation. Ageing significantly perturbed the activation of the core immune response program by increasing expression heterogeneity across different populations of CD4$^+$ T cells. This discovery adds transcriptional noise as an unexplored hallmark of ageing to the list of known phenotypic changes.

Martinez-Jimenez performed all single-cell RNA sequencing experiments displayed in this chapter. Hung-Chang Chen and Maike de la Roche provided extensive support during the revision process. Hung-Chang Chen performed FACS experiments during the revision process. Lovorka Stojic and Frances Connor provided experimental support. Timothy F. Rayner provided technical support. Michael J. T. Stubbington performed the T cell receptor and clone analysis. Catalina A. Vallejos helped with the statistical analysis by providing additional explanations of the BASiCS model. Celia P. Martinez-Jimenez and I interpreted results. Celia P. Martinez-Jimenez, Duncan T. Odom, John C. Marioni and I wrote the manuscript. Duncan T. Odom and John C. Marioni supervised the study.
