\chapter{Correcting the mean-variability dependency in scRNA-Seq data}  

\graphicspath{{Chapter2/Figures/}}

\begin{Abstract}
Cell-to-cell transcriptional variability in otherwise homogeneous cell populations plays a crucial role in tissue function and development. Single-cell RNA sequencing can characterise this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinders meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce an analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. This includes a robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available.
We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronisation of biosynthetic machinery components in immune cells upon activation. In contrast to the uniform up-regulation of the biosynthetic machinery, CD4$^+$ T cells show heterogeneous up-regulation of immune-related and lineage-defining genes during activation and differentiation.

\begin{Comment}
\textbf{Declaration} I worked on this project in close collaboration with Catalina Vallejos, Arianne Richard, Sylvia Richardson and John Marioni. Catalina Vallejos co-supervised me and taught me principles of Bayesian statistics which helped me to extend the BASiCS framework. Arianne Richard helped with the interpretation of biological data and helped writing the manuscript. Sylvia Richardson provided statstical help on a part of the project that is not presented here. John Marioni co-supervised me and suggested analysis to be performed. Catalina Vallejos, John Marioni and I designed the study. Catalina Vallejos, John Marioni and I wrote the manuscript.
